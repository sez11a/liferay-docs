## Authentication

The first time you create or edit a Documents and Media file via Office 
365&trade;, you must authenticate with your Microsoft account. This links 
OneDrive&trade; to your @product@ account, so you only need to do this once. You 
can unlink your account at any time by navigating to User Menu &rarr; 
*Account Settings* &rarr; *General* &rarr; *Apps*, and clicking *Revoke* next to 
OneDrive&trade;.

## Creating Files

Follow these steps to create a new Documents and Media file via Office 
365&trade;: 

1.  Open the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    click your site's name, and navigate to *Content & Data* &rarr; 
    *Documents and Media*. 

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) 
    and select the type of Office 365 document to add to the Document Library: 

    -   Word&trade;
    -   Excel&trade;
    -   PowerPoint&trade;

    When you select one of these options, @product@ creates a temporary 
    Documents and Media file and links it to a new Office 365 file. Your browser 
    then opens a new window with that Office 365 file so you can create its 
    content.

3.  Use the Office 365&trade; editor to create your document's content. 

4.  Save your changes to @product@, or discard them: 

    **Check in:** Saves the Office 365 file to Documents and Media, then deletes 
    the file from Office 365. The saved file's format depends on the document 
    type you selected in step two above. 

    -   Word: Microsoft Word&trade; (`.docx`)
    -   PowerPoint: Microsoft PowerPoint&trade; (`.pptx`)
    -   Excel: Microsoft Excel&trade; (`.xlsx`)

    **Cancel Checkout:** Deletes the Office 365 file, discarding any changes.
