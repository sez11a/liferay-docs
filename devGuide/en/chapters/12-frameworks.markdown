# Liferay Frameworks [](id=liferay-framewor-1)

Picture a hot, summer day. You're on vacation, and you're just coming back from
the beach after a day of frolicking on the sand and in the water. After all that
activity, you're hungry. Time to grill up some burgers and dogs. 

To grill hamburgers and hot dogs, you have to have a proper procedure and
apparatus for accomplishing the task. The *procedure* would be called an
algorithm in computer science terms. The *apparatus* is the framework. 

You first need a grill. That grill should be equipped with a heating mechanism;
in the case of most grills, that's either charcoal or propane gas. Obviously,
it also has a metal frame, or grill, placed near the heat. You also need tools,
such as a spatula, a plate to hold the meat, and if you're making chicken in
addition to those burgers, a brush and some barbecue sauce. 

All of these together form a *framework* for making grilled food on a hot
summer day. All the tools you need are at your disposal; you just need to pick
them up and get grilling! If the framework is already in place, it's obviously
a lot easier (and more timely) to cook food than it would be if the framework
weren't there. Just ask the cave men. 

Liferay contains several frameworks that give you all the tools you need to
perform various common tasks, such has handling permissions, letting users
enter comments, categories, and tags, and other common tasks that Liferay
doesn't make you have to write yourself. 

Here's what we've got in store for you: 

- Security and Permissions 
- Asset Framework 
- File Storage Framework 
- Other Frameworks 

Let's start by getting acquainted with a framework that nobody relishes having
to write themselves: security. 

## Security and Permissions [](id=security-and-permissio-4)

The Java portlet standard defines a simple security scheme using portlet roles and
their mapping to portal roles. On top of that, Liferay provides a fine-grained
permissions system you can use to implement access security in your custom
portlets. Here we'll give an overview of the standard Java security system,
Liferay's permission system, and how to use them in your own portlets. 

### JSR Portlet Security [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-jsr-portlet-security-0)

The JSR specification defines a means to specify roles used by portlets in their
`portlet.xml` definitions. The role names themselves, however, are not
standardized, so when these portlets run in Liferay, you'll recognize familiar
role names. For example, the Liferay Blogs portlet definition references the
*guest*, *power-user*, and *user* roles: 

	<portlet>
		<portlet-name>33</portlet-name>
		<display-name>Blogs</display-name>
		<portlet-class>com.liferay.portlet.StrutsPortlet</portlet-class>
		<init-param>
			<name>view-action</name>
			<value>/blogs/view</value>
		</init-param>
		<init-param>
			<name>config-jsp</name>
			<value>/html/portlet/blogs/configuration.jsp</value>
		</init-param>
		<expiration-cache>0</expiration-cache>
		<supports>
			<mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
		</supports>
		<resource-bundle>com.liferay.portlet.StrutsResourceBundle</resource-bundle>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>guest</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>power-user</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>user</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<supported-public-render-parameter>categoryId</supported-public-render-parameter>
		<supported-public-render-parameter>tag</supported-public-render-parameter>
	</portlet>

Your `portlet.xml` roles need to be mapped to specific roles in the portal.
That way the portal can resolve conflicts between roles with the same name that
are from different portlets (e.g. portlets from different developers). 

---

![note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** Each role named in a portlet's
`<security-role-ref>` element is given permission to add the portlet to a page. 

---

To map the roles to the portal, you'll have to use a Liferay-specific
configuration file called `liferay-portlet.xml`. For an example, see the mapping
defined inside `liferay-portlet.xml` found in `portal-web/docroot/WEB-INF`: 

    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>administrator</role-name>
        <role-link>Administrator</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>guest</role-name>
        <role-link>Guest</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>power-user</role-name>
        <role-link>Power User</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>user</role-name>
        <role-link>User</role-link>
    </role-mapper>

<!-- Better to use an example from plugins here, rather than from an internal
portlet. -Rich -->

If a portlet definition references the role `power-user`, that portlet is
mapped to the Liferay role called *Power User* that's already in its database. 

Once roles are mapped to the portal, you can use methods as defined in portlet
specification: 

- `getRemoteUser()`
- `isUserInRole()`
- `getUserPrincipal()`

For example, you can use the following code to check if the current user has
the `power-user` role:

    if (renderRequest.isUserInRole("power-user")) {
        // ...
    }

By default, Liferay doesn't use the `isUserInRole()` method in any built-in
portlets. Liferay uses its own permission system directly to achieve more
fine-grained security. Next we'll describe Liferay's permission system and
how to use it in your portlets. We recommend using Liferay's permission system,
because it offers a much more robust way of tailoring your application's
permissions. 

### Liferay's Permission System [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-liferays-permission-system-overview-0)

You can add permissions to your custom portlets using four easy steps (also
known as DRAC): 

1. **D**efine all resources and their permissions. 

2. **R**egister all defined resources in the permissions system. This is also
   known as *adding resources*. 

3. **A**ssociate the necessary permissions with resources.

4. **C**heck permission before returning resources. 

Before you start adding permissions to a portlet, make sure you understand
these two critical terms used throughout this section: 

- *Resource*: A generic term for any object represented in the portal.
  Examples of resources include portlets (e.g. Message Boards, Calendar, etc.),
Java classes (e.g. Message Board Topics, Calendar Events, etc.), and files
(e.g.  documents, images, etc.). 
- *Permission*: An action on a resource. For example, the *view* action with
respect to *viewing the calendar portlet* is defined as a permission in Liferay.

It's important to know that permissions for *portlet* resources are implemented
a little differently than for other resources like Java classes and files.
Below, we'll describe permission implementation for the *portlet* resource
first, followed by the model resource. 

<!-- We definitely should not be using the Blogs portlet to illustrate this, as
the patterns are different from what plugin developers would do. For example, in
a plugin, the convention is to create default.xml in the resource-actions folder
of a plugin, and that's what developers reading this will do. We should find
another portlet to serve as our example portlet. -Rich -->

The first step is to define your resources and the actions that can be defined
on them. Let's use the Blogs portlet to demonstrate. Open the `blogs.xml` file in
`portal-impl/src/resource-actions` and you'll see the following mapping of
resources to actions: 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>

                <guest-defaults>

                </guest-unsupported>
            </permissions>
            ...
        </model-resource>
    </resource-action-mapping>

Permissions in the blogs portlet are defined at two different levels: the
portlet level and the model level. The portlet level defines permissions on the
portlet as a whole. The model level defines permissions on the model layer of
the application, as defined by the entities in the application. Each level
coincides with a section of the `resource-actions` XML file (in this case,
`blogs.xml`). 

At the `<portlet-resource>` level, actions and default permissions
are defined on the portlet itself. Changes to portlet level permissions are
performed on a per-site basis, and define whether users can add the portlet to a
page, edit the portlet's configuration, or view the portlet.  All these actions
are defined in the `<supports>` tag for the portlet resource's permissions. The
default portlet-level permissions for members of the site are defined in the
`<site-member-defaults>` tag. In the case of the Blogs portlet, site members can
view any blog in the site. Similarly, default guest permissions are defined in
the `<guest-defaults>` tag. The `<guest-unsupported>` tag contains permissions
forbidden to guests. Here, guests can't be given permission to configure the
portlet. 

The `<model-resource>` section contains the next level of permissions, based on
the *scope* of an individual instance of the portlet. A scope in Liferay
refers to how widely the data from an instance of a portlet is shared. For
example, if you place a Blogs portlet on a page in the guest site and place
another Blogs portlet on another page in the same site, the two blogs share the
same set of posts. That happens because portlets are given a site level scope by
default. If you reconfigure one of the two Blogs and change its scope to be the
current page, that Blogs portlet instance no longer shares content with the
other instance (or any other Blogs instance in that site). A portlet instance's
scope-based permissions can thus span an entire site or be restricted to a
single page. If you set the scope to the page, it's possible to have multiple
distinct Blog instances within a site, each with different permissions for site
users. For example, a food site could have one blog open to posts from any site
member, but also have a separate informational blog about the site itself
restricted to posts from administrators. 

After defining the portlet and portlet instance as resources, we need to define
permissions on the models in the portlet. The model resource is surrounded by
the `<model-resource>` tag. Inside the tag, we first define the model name; the
`<model-name>` isn't the name of a Java class, but the fully qualified name of
the portlet's package (e.g. the blog portlet's package
`com.liferay.portlet.blogs`). This is the recommended convention for permissions
that refer to an instance of the portlet as a whole. Permissions like the
ability to *add* or *subscribe to* a blog entry are defined here, and affect the
portlet at the instance level. The `<portlet-ref>` element comes next and
contains a `<portlet-name>`. The value of `<portlet-name>` references the name
of the portlet to which the model resource belongs. Theoretically, a model
resource can belong to multiple portlets referenced with multiple
`<portlet-name>` elements, but this is uncommon. Like the portlet resource, the
model resource lets you define a list of supported actions that require
permission to perform. You must list all the performable actions that require a
permission check. For a blog entry, users must belong to appropriate roles for
permission to do the following: 

- *Add comments* to an entry 
- *Delete* an entry 
- *Change the permission* setting of an entry 
- *Update* an entry 
- *View* an entry 

As with a portlet resource, the `<site-member-defaults>` tag, `<guest-defaults>`
tag, and `<guest-unsupported>` tag define default permissions for site members
and guests, respectively, for *model resources*. 

After defining resource permissions for your custom portlet, you need to refer
Liferay to the `resource-actions` XML file that contains your definitions (e.g.
`blogs.xml` for the Blogs portlet). For Liferay core, the `resource-actions`
XML files are in the `portal/portal-impl/src/resource-actions` directory
and the file named `default.xml` file refers to each of these files. This
excerpt from `default.xml` references the resource permission definition files
for all built-in Liferay portlets (including the blogs portlet): 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE resource-action-mapping PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Resource Action Mapping 6.1.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-resource-action-mapping_6_1_0.dtd">
	
    <resource-action-mapping>
        <resource file="resource-actions/portal.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/announcements.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/asset.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/blogs.xml" />
        ...
    </resource-action-mapping>

You should put your plugin's `resource-actions` XML files (e.g.  `default.xml`
and `blogs.xml`) in a directory in your project's classpath. Then create a
properties file (typically named `portlet.properties`) for your portlet that
references the the file that specifies your `<resource-action-mapping>` element
(e.g. `default.xml`). In this portlet properties file, create a property
named `resource.actions.configs` with the relative path to your portlet's
resource-action mapping file (e.g.  `default.xml`) as its value. Here's what
this property specification might look like: 

    resource.actions.configs=resource-actions/default.xml

Check out a copy of the Liferay source code from the Liferay Github repository
to see an example of a portlet that defines its resources and permissions as we
just described; start by looking at the definition files found in the
`portal-impl/src/resource-actions` directory. For an example of defining
permissions in the context of a portlet plugin, check out `plugins/trunk` and
look at the portlet `sample-permissions-portlet`. 

Next we'll show you how to add resources. 

<!-- I didn't see any point to the permission algorithms section. It didn't seem
to lead anywhere, and developers who have been approaching Liferay have been met
with a default Algorithm 6 for two releases now. Algorithm 6 is now required for
the proper operation of Liferay, so the only people who need to worry about the
older algorithms are those who are upgrading, and we cover that in the upgrading
section of the User Guide. The API described below works the same regardless of
which permissions algorithm is used. For these reasons, I removed the whole
section. It seems to improve the flow: we just left off talking about portal
resources in the XML file, and now it goes right into the code. -Rich -->

### Adding a Resource [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-adding-a-resource-0)

After defining resources and actions, it's time to add resources into the
permissions system. Resources are added at the same time entities are added to
the database. Managing resources follows the same pattern you've seen throughout
Liferay: there's a service to use. Adding resources is as easy as calling the
`addResources(...)` method of the `ResourceLocalServiceUtil` class. Here's the
signature of that method: 

    public void addResources(
        long companyId, long groupId, long userId, String name,
        String primKey, boolean portletActions,
        boolean addGroupPermissions, boolean addGuestPermissions)

Each Entity that requires access permission must be added as a resource
every time it is stored. For example, every time a user adds a new
entry to her blog, the `addResources(...)` method must be called to add the
new entry object to the resource system. Here's an example of the call from the
`BlogsEntryLocalServiceImpl` class: 

    resourceLocalService.addResources(
        entry.getCompanyId(), entry.getGroupId(), entry.getUserId(),
        BlogsEntry.class.getName(), entry.getEntryId(), false,
        addGroupPermissions, addGuestPermissions);

In the `addResources(...)` method, the parameters `companyId`, `groupId`, and
`userId` correspond to the portal instance, the site in which the entity is
being saved, and the user who is saving it. Let's look more closely at the
remaining parameters: 

- The `name` parameter is the fully qualified Java class name for the 
  entity being added. 
- The `primKey` parameter is the primary key of the entity. 
- The `portletActions` parameter should be set to `true` if you're adding
  portlet action permissions. In our example, it's `false` because we're adding
  a model resource, which should be associated with permissions related to the
  model action defined in `blogs.xml`. 
- The `addGroupPermissions` and the `addGuestPermissions` parameters are inputs
  from the user. If set to `true`, `ResourceLocalService` adds the default
  permissions to the current group and the guest group for this resource,
  respectively. 

You can let your users choose whether to add the default site permission and/or
the guest permission for your custom portlet resources: Liferay has a custom
JSP tag `<liferay-ui:input-permissions />` that you can use to quickly add that
functionality. You just insert the tag into the appropriate JSP and the
checkboxes appear on that page. Make sure that the tag is inside the
appropriate `<form>` tags, and that's all there is to it. 

When you remove entities from the database, it's good practice to remove
permissions mapped directly to the entity. To prevent dead resources from
taking up space in the `Resource_` database table, remember to remove them from
the `Resource_` table when the resource no longer applies. Do this by calling
the `deleteResource(...)` method of `ResourceLocalServiceService`. Here's an
example of a blogs entry being removed: 

    resourceLocalService.deleteResource(
        entry.getCompanyId(), BlogsEntry.class.getName(),
        ResourceConstants.SCOPE_INDIVIDUAL, entry.getEntryId());

Great! Now that you know how to work with resource permissions, we'll show you
how to provide a user interface for managing resource permissions. 

### Adding Permission [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-adding-permission-0)

On the portlet level, no code needs to be written in order to have the
permission system work for your custom portlet. If you've defined any custom
permissions (supported actions) in your configuration file's `portlet-resource`
tag, they're automatically added to a list of permissions in Liferay's
permissions UI. What good, however, are permissions that are available but can't
be set by users? 

To let a user set permissions on model resources, you must expose the permission
interface to the user. Just add these two Liferay UI tags to your JSP:

1.  `<liferay-security:permissionsURL>`: Returns a URL to the permission
    settings configuration page. 

2. `<liferay-ui:icon>`: Shows an icon to the user. These are defined in the
    theme, and one of them (see below) is used for permissions. 

This example demonstrates the use of both tags; it comes from the
`view_entry_content.jspf`file. 

    <liferay-security:permissionsURL
        modelResource="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
        modelResourceDescription="<%= entry.getTitle() %>"
        resourcePrimKey="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey().toString() %>"
        var="entryURL"
    />

    <liferay-ui:icon image="permissions" url="<%= entryURL %>" />

For the first tag, specify the following attributes: 

- `modelResource`: The fully qualified Java object class name. This class name
  gets translated into its more readable name as specified in
  `Language.properties`. 
- `modelResourceDescription`: You can pass in anything that best describes
  this model instance. In this example, the blogs title was passed in. 
- `resourcePrimKey`: The primary key of your model instance. 
- `var`: Specifies the name of the variable to be assigned the resulting URL
  String. The variable is then passed to the `<liferay-ui:icon>` tag so the
  permission icon has the proper URL link. 

There's an optional attribute called `redirect` that's available if you want to
override the default behavior of the upper right arrow link. That's it; now your
users can configure the permission settings for model resources. 

Next we'll show you how to implement permissions checking. 

### Checking Permissions [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-checking-permissions-0)

The last major step toward implementing permissions for your custom portlet is
to ensure the configured permissions are enforced. You'll do this by adding
permission checks to your application. For example, your business layer can
check for permission before deleting a resource, or your user interface can hide
a button that adds an entity (e.g. a calendar event) if the user doesn't have
permission. 

You need to implement checking of any custom permissions you defined in your
`resource-actions` XML file. In the Blogs portlet, one supported custom action
is `ADD_ENTRY`. There are two places in the source code to check for this
permission: in your JSP files and in the business logic. For the JSP files, you
want to wrap certain elements in permission checks, so they only appear for
users with the permission to perform those functions. For example, the presence
of the Add Entry button is contingent on whether the user has permission to add
a blog entry.  Here's the `ADD_ENTRY` action in a JSP file: 

    <%
    if (permissionChecker.hasPermission(
        scopeGroupId, "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model",
        scopeGroupId, "ADD_ENTRY") {
        // Show add entry button
    }
    %>

The second place to check for the add entry permission is in the business
logic. If the check fails, a `PrincipalException` is thrown `and the add entry
request is aborted:`

    if (!permissionChecker.hasPermission(
        scopeGroupId, "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model",
        scopeGroupId, "ADD_ENTRY")) {
            throw new PrincipalException();
    }

    blogsEntryLocalService.addEntry(...);

The `PermissionChecker` class has a method `hasPermission(...)` that checks
whether a user making a resource request has the necessary access permission.
If the user isn't signed in (guest user), it checks for guest permissions.
Otherwise, it checks for user permissions. Let's quickly review the parameters
of this method: 

-   `groupId`: Represents the scope where the permission check is performed. In
    Liferay, many scopes are available, including a specific site, organization,
    personal site of a user, or a page in a site. This is important because a
    user may be allowed to add blog entries in one site, but not in another. For
    resources that don't belong to a scope (extremely rare and unlikely), set
    the value of this parameter to `0`. There are several ways you can obtain
    the `groupId` of the current scope: 

    -   JSP that uses the `<theme:defineObjects/>` tag: there's an implicit
        variable called `scopeGroupId`.
    -   Business logic class: If you're using the ServiceContext pattern, you
        can obtain the `groupId` by using `serviceContext.getScopeGroupId()`. If
        you're not using the `ServiceContext` pattern, your can obtain `groupId`
        from the theme display request object: 

            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)request.getAttribute(
            WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);
            long scopeGroupId = themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId();

    -   `name`: The name of the resource as specified in the XML file of the
        previous sections. 
    -   `primKey`: The primary key of the resource. In this example the resource
        doesn't exist as an entry in the database, so we use the `groupId`
        again. If we were checking for a permission on a given blog entry, we'd
        use the primary key of that blog entry instead. 
    -   `actionId`: The name of the action as it appears in the XML file. To
        simplify searching for usages, consider creating a helper class that has
        constants for all the actions defined. 

In the examples above, we're assuming there's a variable called
`permissionChecker` already available. Liferay automatically creates a
`PermissionChecker` instance that has the necessary information from the user
for every request. Liferay also caches the security checks to ensure good
performance. There are several ways to obtain a permission checker: 

-   In a JSP that uses the `<theme:defineObjects/>` tag, there's an implicit
    variable called `permissionChecker`. 
-   With Service Builder, every service implementation class can access the
    `PermissionChecker` instance by using the method `getPermissionChecker()`. 
-   If you're not using Service Builder, `PermissionChecker` can be obtained from
    the theme display request object: 

        ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)
            request.getAttribute(WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);
        PermissionChecker permissionChecker = themeDisplay.getPermissionChecker();

Next you'll optimize permission checking by creating helper classes to do most
of the heavy lifting.

### Creating Helper Classes for Permission Checking [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-creating-helper-classes-for-permission-checking-0)

Helper classes streamline your code. They encapsulate the use of
`permissionChecker` and the names of the resources for a specific portlet. This
is especially useful when there are complex parent-child relationships, or if
your permission logic calls for checking multiple action types.
`BlogsPermission` is an example of a permission helper class. Here's how
`BlogsPermission` is used in a JSP: 

    <%
    if (BlogsPermission.contains(permissionChecker, scopeGroupId,
        ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY)) {
        // show add entry button
        }
    %>

Now let's see how a `ServiceImpl` class `BlogsEntryServiceImpl` uses the
`BlogsPermission` helper class. In the method
`BlogsEntryServiceImpl.addEntry(...)`, a call is made to check whether the
incoming request has permission to add an entry. The check is done using the
helper class `BlogsPermission`. If the check fails, it throws a
`PrincipalException` and the add entry request aborts. 

    public BlogsEntry addEntry(
        String title, String description, String content,
        int displayDateMonth, int displayDateDay, int displayDateYear,
        int displayDateHour, int displayDateMinute, boolean allowPingbacks,
        boolean allowTrackbacks, String[] trackbacks, boolean smallImage,
        String smallImageURL, String smallImageFileName,
        InputStream smallImageInputStream, ServiceContext serviceContext)
        throws PortalException, SystemException {

        BlogsPermission.check(
            getPermissionChecker(), serviceContext.getScopeGroupId(),
            ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY);

        return blogsEntryLocalService.addEntry(
            getUserId(), title, description, content, displayDateMonth,
            displayDateDay, displayDateYear, displayDateHour, displayDateMinute,
            allowPingbacks, allowTrackbacks, trackbacks, smallImage,
            smallImageURL, smallImageFileName, smallImageInputStream,
            serviceContext);
    }

Check out the parameters passed into the `check(...)` method. Again, the
`getPermissionChecker()` method is readily available in all `ServiceImpl`
classes. The blogs entry ID is available in the `serviceContext`, indicating
that the permission check is against the Blogs portlet. `ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY`
is a static string used to indicate the action requiring the permission check.
Likewise, you're encouraged to use custom portlet action keys. 

<!-- We're not ready for review yet. We haven't covered how to create the helper
class, which is what the reader is expecting out of this section. Certainly I
was. We've only seen how to use a helper class that already exists. -Rich -->

Let's review what we've just covered. Implementing permission into your custom
portlet consists of four main steps: 
 
1.  Define any custom resources and actions. 

2.  Implement code to register (or add) any newly created resources, such as a
    `BlogsEntry` object. 

3.  Provide an interface for the user to configure permission. 

4.  Implement code to check permission before returning resources or showing
    custom features.  

The two major resources are portlets and entities. Liferay does most of the work
for you by providing a configuration file and a system of resources that let you
check permissions wherever you need to in your application. 

You're now equipped to implement security in your custom Liferay portlets! 

Next, let's learn how to use the Asset Framework. 

## Asset Framework [](id=asset-framewo-4)

Liferay's asset framework is a system that allow you to add common functionality
to your application. For example, you might build an event management
application that shows a list of upcoming events. It might be nice to be able to
tag or categorize those events to provide users with metadata describing more
about them. Or you might want to let users comment on events. 

This common functionality is what Liferay's asset framework gives you. Using the
power of Liferay's built-in message boards, tags, and categories, Liferay lets
you infuse your application with these features in no time. 
 
The term *asset* is a generic term referring to any type of content,
including text, an external file, a URL, an image, or a record in an online
book library. Consequently, when we use the term *asset* here, we're referring
to some type of Liferay content, like documents, blog entries, bookmarks, wiki
pages, or anything you create in your applications. 

Here are the features you can reuse thanks to the asset framework: 

-   Associate tags to custom content types. New tags are created automatically
    when the author assigns them to the content. 
-   Associate categories to custom content types. Authors are only allowed to
    select from predefined categories within several predefined vocabularies. 
-   Manage tags from the control panel, including merging tags. 
-   Manage categories from the control panel, including creating complex
    hierarchies. 
-   Associate comments with assets. 
-   Rate assets using a five star rating system. 
-   Assign social bookmarks to assets, including via tweet, Facebook like, or +1
    (Google Plus). 
-   Add custom fields to assets. 
-   Relate assets to one another. 
-   Flag asset content as inappropriate. 
-   Keep track of the number of visualizations of an asset. 
-   Integrate workflow with assets. 
-   Publish your content using the Asset Publisher portlet. Asset Publisher can
    publish dynamic asset lists or manually selected asset lists. It can also
    show an asset summary view with a link to the full view. This saves you time,
    since it likely won't be necessary to develop custom portlets for your custom
    content types. 

At this point you might be saying, "Asset Framework sounds great; but how do I
leverage all these awesome functions?" Excellent question, young padawan, and
perfect timing; we couldn't have said it better ourselves. 

We'll describe the first two briefly here before we dive in head first: 

-   The first step is mandatory; you must let the framework know whenever one of
    your custom content entries is added, updated or deleted. 
-   The second step enables the asset framework in the UI: you can use a
    set of taglibs to provide widgets that allow authors to enter comments, tags
    and categories, as well as how to show the entered tags and categories along
    with the content. 

<!--I don't understand the second half of the second step, after the comma.
-Russ -->

<!-- It was confusingly written; hopefully I fixed it. -Rich -->

<!--It's still confusing to me, as it says taglibs provide widgets that allow
authors to enter comments, tags and categories, as well as how to...I wasn't
expecting a how to here and it doesn't work, does it? since it's originally
saying taglibs provide widgets that allow...-->

Next let's dive head first into the first step; informing the Asset Framework
when you add, update, or delete assets. 

#### Adding, updating and deleting assets [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-adding-updating-and-deleting-assets-0)

Whenever you create a new entity, you need to let the Asset Framework know. In
this sense, it's similar to permission resources. It's a simple procedure: you
invoke a method of the Asset Framework that adds an `AssetEntry` so that Liferay
can keep track of the asset. 

Specifically, you should access these methods using either the static methods
of `AssetLocalServiceUtil` or an instance of the `AssetEntryLocalService`
injected by Spring. To simplify this section, we'll be using the static methods
of `AssetLocalServiceUtil`, since it doesn't require any special setup in your
application. 

<!-- This is wrong. We should show them the right way to do it, rather than the
way that's easier to document. Remember that developers will be taking direction
from our text and writing actual code based on it. The right way is to add a
<reference> tag to the service.xml and inject the service with Spring. In fact,
the example below does just that (since it's Liferay's best practice), so the
example code here doesn't even match what we just stated. We need to fix this.
-Rich--> 

The method to invoke when one of your custom content entries is added or
updated is the same, and is called `updateEntry`. Here's the full signature: 

    AssetEntry updateEntry(
            long userId, long groupId, String className, long classPK,
            String classUuid, long classTypeId, long[] categoryIds,
            String[] tagNames, boolean visible, Date startDate, Date endDate,
            Date publishDate, Date expirationDate, String mimeType,
            String title, String description, String summary, String url,
            String layoutUuid, int height, int width, Integer priority,
            boolean sync)
        throws PortalException, SystemException

Here's an example of this method's invocation extracted from the built in
blogs portlet: 

    assetEntryLocalService.updateEntry(
            userId, entry.getGroupId(), BlogsEntry.class.getName(),
            entry.getEntryId(), entry.getUuid(), 0, assetCategoryIds,
            assetTagNames, visible, null, null, entry.getDisplayDate(), null,
            ContentTypes.TEXT_HTML, entry.getTitle(), null, summary, null, null,
            0, 0, null, false);

Here's a quick summary of the most important parameters of this method: 

-   `userId` is the identifier of the user who created the content. 
-   `groupId` identifies the scope of the created content. If your content
    doesn't support scopes (extremely rare), just pass `0` as the value. 
-   `className` identifies the type of asset. The recommended convention is to
    use the name of the Java class that represents your content type, but you can
    actually use any String you want as long as you are sure that it is unique. 
-   `classPK` identifies the specific content being created among others of the
    same type. It's usually the primary key of the table where the custom content
    is stored. If you want, you can use the *classUuid* parameter to specify a
    secondary identifier; it's guaranteed to be universally unique. It's especially
    useful if your content will be exported and imported across separate portals. 
-   `assetCategoryIds` and `assetTagNames` represent the categories and tags
    selected by the author of the content. The Asset Framework will store them
    for you. 
-   `visible` specifies whether the content should be shown at all by Asset
    Publisher. 
-   `title,` `description` and `summary` are descriptive fields used by the Asset
    Publisher when displaying entries of your content type. 
-   `publishDate` and `expirationDate`, when specified, tell Asset Publisher it
    shouldn't show the content before a given publication date or after a given
    expiration date, respectively. 
-   All other fields are optional; it won't always make sense to include them.
    The `sync` parameter should always be *false* unless you're doing something
    very advanced (feel free to look at the code if you're really curious). 

<!-- We should fully describe the sync parameter, as well as any others.
Otherwise, it looks like we're holding back information for no apparent reason.
-Rich -->

When one of your custom content entries is deleted, you should once again let
Asset Framework know. That way it can clean up stored information and make sure
that the Asset Publisher doesn't show any information for the content that has
been deleted. The signature of method to delete an asset entry is: 

    void deleteEntry(String className, long classPK)

Here's an example invocation extracted again from the blogs portlet: 

    assetEntryLocalService.deleteEntry(
        BlogsEntry.class.getName(), entry.getEntryId());

Now that you can create and modify assets, consider tagging and categorizing
them. Let's tackle that next. 

#### Entering and displaying tags and categories [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-entering-and-displaying-tags-and-categories-0)

In the last section we let Asset Framework know about the tags and categories
that we associated with a given asset; but how does a content author specify
the tags and categories? 

Liferay provides a set of JSP tags you can use to make this task very easy. You
can put the following Liferay UI tags in your forms to create content that can
be associated with new or existing tags or predefined categories: 

    <label>Tags</label>
    <liferay-ui:asset-tags-selector
        className="<%= entry.getClass().getName() %>"
        classPK="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey() %>"
    />

    <label>Categories</label>
        <liferay-ui:asset-categories-selector
            className="<%= entry.getClass().getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey() %>"
    />

These two taglibs create appropriate form controls that allow the user to
search for a tag or create a new one or select an existing category. 

---

![tip](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Tip:** If you're using Liferay's Alloy
UI Form taglibs, creating fields to enter tags and categories is even simpler.
You just use `<aui:input name="tags" type="assetTags" />` and `<aui:input
name="categories" type="assetCategories" />`, respectively. 

---

Once the tags and categories have been entered, you'll want to show them along
with the content of the asset. Here's how to display the tags and categories: 

    <label>Tags</label>
    <liferay-ui:asset-tags-summary
        className="<%= entry.getClass().getName() %>"
        classPK="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey() %>"
    />

    <label>Categories</label>
    <liferay-ui:asset-categories-summary
        className="<%= entry.getClass().getName() %>"
        classPK="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey() %>"
    />

In both JSP tags, you can also specify a `portletURL` parameter; each tag that
uses it will be a link containing the `portletURL` *and* `tag` or `categoryId`
parameter value, respectively. This supports tags navigation and categories
navigation within your portlet. You'll need to implement the look-up
functionality in your portlet code; do this by reading the values of those two
parameters and using the `AssetEntryService` to query the database for entries
based on the specified tag or category. 

<!-- An example of this would be really nice. -Rich -->

Great job! You'll have no problem associating tags and categories with your
assets. Before we go further with our example, let's take a look at more JSP
tags you can use to leverage Asset Framework's features. 

#### More JSP tags for assets [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-more-jsp-tags-for-assets-0)

In addition to tags and categories, there are more features that Asset Framework
provides. These features allow users to do the following with your assets: 

-   Add comments
-   Rate comments of other users
-   Rate assets
-   Apply social bookmarks (e.g. via tweet, Facebook like, or +1 (Google Plus))
-   Relate assets to one another
-   Flag content as inappropriate and notify the portal administrator

There are JSP tags, called *Liferay UI* tags, associated with each feature. You
can find these tags used in the JSPs for Liferay's built-in portlets (e.g. the
`edit_entry.jsp` of the Blogs portlet).  Here are some examples of the JSP tags
from the Blogs portlet: 

-   *Comments and comment ratings:* 

        <portlet:actionURL var="discussionURL">
            <portlet:param name="struts_action" value="/blogs/edit_entry_discussion" />
        </portlet:actionURL>

        <liferay-ui:discussion
            className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= entry.getEntryId() %>"
            formAction="<%= discussionURL %>"
            formName="fm2"
            ratingsEnabled="<%= enableCommentRatings %>"
            redirect="<%= currentURL %>"
            subject="<%= entry.getTitle() %>"
            userId="<%= entry.getUserId() %>"
        />

-   *Rate assets:* 

        <liferay-ui:ratings
            className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= entry.getEntryId() %>"
        />

-   *Social Bookmarks:* 

        <liferay-ui:social-bookmarks
            displayStyle="<%= socialBookmarksDisplayStyle %>"
            target="_blank"
            title="<%= entry.getTitle() %>"
            url="<%= PortalUtil.getCanonicalURL(bookmarkURL.toString(), themeDisplay) %>"
        />

-   *Related assets:* 

        <liferay-ui:input-asset-links
            className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= entryId %>"
        />

-   *Flag as inappropriate:* 

        <liferay-ui:flags
            className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= entry.getEntryId() %>"
            contentTitle="<%= entry.getTitle() %>"
            reportedUserId="<%= entry.getUserId() %>"
        />

<!-- The above features need more explanation and sections of their own. We
don't need to do this now, but we should do it later, for the 6.2 release. -Rich
-->

With Liferay's taglib tags, you can easily apply these features to your assets.
No problemo, right? So let's get the assets published in your portal. 

#### Publishing assets with Asset Publisher [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-publishing-assets-with-asset-publisher-0)

A huge benefit of using the asset framework is that you can leverage the Asset
Publisher portlet to publish lists of your custom asset types. You can choose
to have users specify lists dynamically (e.g., based on the asset tags or
categories) or have administrators do it statically. 

To display your assets, the Asset Publisher needs to know how to access their
metadata. You also need to provide the Asset Publisher templates for the types
of views (e.g. *full* view and *abstract* view) available to display your
assets. You can provide all this to the Asset Publisher by implementing these
two interfaces: 

-   `AssetRendererFactory`: A class that knows how to retrieve specific assets
    from persistent storage using the `classPK`. The `classPK` is typically the
    asset's primary key, but can be anything you specified to the `updateAsset`
    method, which you use to add or update the asset. Your factory implementation
    can grab the asset from a `groupId` (identifies a scope of data) and a
    `urlTitle` (a title that can be used in friendly URLs to refer uniquely to the
    asset within a given scope). Finally, the asset renderer factory can provide a
    URL for the Asset Publisher to use when a user wants to add a new asset of your
    custom type. This URL should point to your own portlet.  There are other less
    important methods of the interface, but you can avoid implementing them by
    extending `BaseAssetRendererFactory`. By extending this base class instead of
    implementing the interface directly, your code will be more robust to possible
    interface changes in future versions of Liferay, since the base implementation
    will be updated to accommodate the interface changes. 
-   `AssetRenderer`: This is an interface that provides metadata information
    about one specific asset. It checks whether the current user has permission
    to edit or view the asset and renders the asset for the different templates
    (e.g. abstract and full content view) by forwarding to a specific JSP. We
    recommend that you extend the `BaseAssetRenderer` class rather than directly
    implementing the interface. The base class provides helpful defaults and 
    contains methods that get added to the interface in the future. 

Let's look at an example of these two classes. We'll use Liferay's Blogs
portlet again, and we'll start by implementing `AssetRendererFactory`:

    public class BlogsEntryAssetRendererFactory extends BaseAssetRendererFactory {

        public static final String CLASS_NAME = BlogsEntry.class.getName();

        public static final String TYPE = "blog";

        public AssetRenderer getAssetRenderer(long classPK, int type)
            throws PortalException, SystemException {

            BlogsEntry entry = BlogsEntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntry(classPK);

            return new BlogsEntryAssetRenderer(entry);
        }

        @Override
        public AssetRenderer getAssetRenderer(long groupId, String urlTitle)
            throws PortalException, SystemException {

            BlogsEntry entry = BlogsEntryServiceUtil.getEntry(groupId, urlTitle);

            return new BlogsEntryAssetRenderer(entry);
        }

        public String getClassName() {
            return CLASS_NAME;
        }

        public String getType() {
            return TYPE;
        }

        @Override
        public PortletURL getURLAdd(
                LiferayPortletRequest liferayPortletRequest,
                LiferayPortletResponse liferayPortletResponse)
            throws PortalException, SystemException {

            HttpServletRequest request =
                liferayPortletRequest.getHttpServletRequest();

            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)request.getAttribute(
                WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);

            if (!BlogsPermission.contains(
                themeDisplay.getPermissionChecker(),
                themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId(), ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY)) {

                return null;
            }

        PortletURL portletURL = PortletURLFactoryUtil.create(
            request, PortletKeys.BLOGS, getControlPanelPlid(themeDisplay),
            PortletRequest.RENDER_PHASE);

            portletURL.setParameter("struts_action", "/blogs/edit_entry");

            return portletURL;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean hasPermission(
                PermissionChecker permissionChecker, long classPK, String actionId)
            throws Exception {

            return BlogsEntryPermission.contains(
                permissionChecker, classPK, actionId);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean isLinkable() {
            return _LINKABLE;
        }

        @Override
        protected String getIconPath(ThemeDisplay themeDisplay) {
            return themeDisplay.getPathThemeImages() + "/blogs/blogs.png";
        }

        private static final boolean _LINKABLE = true;
    }

Here's the `AssetRenderer` implementation: 

    public class BlogsEntryAssetRenderer extends BaseAssetRenderer {

        public BlogsEntryAssetRenderer(BlogsEntry entry) {
            _entry = entry;

<!--Some long code blocks in here. Not sure if they're too long? -->

<!-- These are too long. Can we abstract out just the functionality we need?
-Rich -->

In the render method, there's a forward to a JSP in the case of the abstract
and the full content templates. The abstract isn't mandatory and if it isn't
provided, the Asset Publisher shows the title and the summary from the
appropriate methods of the renderer. The full content template should always be
provided. Here's how it looks for blogs entries: 

    <%@ include file="/html/portlet/blogs/init.jsp" %>

    <%
    BlogsEntry entry = (BlogsEntry)request.getAttribute(WebKeys.BLOGS_ENTRY);
    %>

    <%= entry.getContent() %>

    <liferay-ui:custom-attributes-available className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>">
        <liferay-ui:custom-attribute-list
            className="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
            classPK="<%= (entry != null) ? entry.getEntryId() : 0 %>"
            editable="<%= false %>"
            label="<%= true %>"
        />
    </liferay-ui:custom-attributes-available>

That's about it. It wasn't that hard, right? Now it's time to get really fancy;
put on your dancing shoes. If you need to extend the capabilities of the
`AssetRendererFactory` for one of Liferay's core portlets, check out the
article [Extending an
AssetRendererFactory](http://www.liferay.com/web/juan.fernandez/blog/-/blogs/extending-an-assetrendererfactory)
by Juan Fern&agrave;ndez; he talks about doing just that. 

<!-- Let's not do this. Blog entries get out of date quickly. Instead, we should
take his blog entry and massage the text to include it right here in the
documentation. -Rich -->

Now get out there and start enjoying the benefits of the Asset Framework in
your custom portlets. 

Let's learn how to leverage Liferay Portal's File Storage Framework. 

## File Storage Framework [](id=file-storage-framewo-1)

The File Storage Framework lets you store files using the back end of the
Document Library. If you use this framework you won't have to worry about
clustering or backups, since they'll already be taken care of for the Document
Library itself. To see examples of this framework in action, check out the
source code for the built in *wiki* and *message boards* portlets of Liferay;
the File Storage Framework stores their attached files in pages and posts,
respectively. 

<!-- This section should be removed, as it amounts to no documentation at all.
We need to cover this properly. -Rich --> 

## Other frameworks [](id=other-framewor-4)

Liferay has a variety of frameworks that simplify development of complex
functionalities for your own applications. Liferay's frameworks have evolved
from its built in applications, so they're proven to work in the real world,
even in high performance portals. 

This section is a placeholder that provides a brief description of the main
frameworks provided with Liferay 6.1. The following list is a work in progress,
since we'll add more sections  to this chapter over time, and some of the
current sections might evolve into their own chapters as we add more
information and detailed instructions on how to use them. 

- *Workflow Framework*: Lets you add Workflow functionality to your own
  portlets. One benefit of using this framework is that you can reuse all the
workflow management UIs Liferay provides. You can also abstract your code from
the specific workflow engine that will be used (e.g., JBPM or Liferay Kaleo).
Many Liferay portlets use this framework; to see a simple example and learn how
you can use it, the blogs portlet is a good start. 
- *Custom Fields*: A portlet that uses custom fields lets the end user extend
  the fields of its data entries with custom fields defined by the end user.
To see a list of data types that support this functionality go to Liferay's
Control Panel &rarr; Custom Fields. 
- *Inline Permissions Framework*: Lets you enhance your SQL queries so the
  database checks for view permissions. This is particularly useful when doing
queries for data entries that might result in many of items, making the
checking of permissions afterward inefficient. It's also useful when you want
to implement pagination (which wouldn't work if permissions are checked
afterward and an item is removed). Liferay's *Document Library* and *Message
Boards* portlets both use this functionality. 
- *Faceted Search*: A new API that simplifies the creation new facet
  configurations and searches. It uses a JSON based configuration to define the
details of facets used for the search. To find out more, see the [Faceted
Search](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/1071674/Faceted+Search)
wiki by Ray Aug&#233;.

Check back in the near future; new editions of the Developer's Guide will have
extended information on each of these frameworks. 

<!-- The above section should also be removed. All of these are implemented and
documented in *Liferay in Action*. -Rich -->

## Summary  [](id=lp-6-1-dgen11-summary--0)

With Liferay's frameworks, implementing complex functionality in your custom
portlets becomes easy. We covered security and permissions and the 
Asset Framework. Make sure  you check back regularly to find more detailed
descriptions of current frameworks and discover brand new frameworks that'll
knock your socks off, or at least simplify your custom portlet development.
