# Preface 
This guide was written as a quick reference to help you get started developing
on the Liferay Portal platform. It is a guide for those who want to get their
hands dirty using Liferay's framework and APIs to create fantastic websites.

For a more exhaustive view into Liferay development, we encourage you to check
out the complete, official guide to Liferay development, *Liferay in Action*,
published by Manning Publications. You can find this book online at

The information contained herein has been organized in a format similar to a
reference, so that it will be easier to find specific details later.
