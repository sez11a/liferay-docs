# Selling Your App or Making it Free [](id=selling-your-app-or-making-it-free)

Do you want to sell your app on the Marketplace? Or do you want to freely share
it with anyone on the Marketplace? It's up to you. Most of the content that
follows describes options for paid apps (apps you sell). 

If you're selling your app, you must publish using a *Paid App Account*. You
must also specify licensing, a price structure, and regional availability for
your paid apps.

Importantly, you can't change the app from free to paid or from paid to free
once the app is published to the Marketplace. Offering the app in the other
license type, requires submitting another app under a different name (title). If
you wish to have both free and paid licenses for your app, you must submit the
app under one name for free licenses and submit it under another name for paid
licenses. Make sure to select the license type (i.e., free or paid) that's best
for your app. 

Have you decided who's going to be listed as the app's author/owner? Have
you decided who's going to manage the app once it's on the Marketplace? App
ownership options are explained next.
