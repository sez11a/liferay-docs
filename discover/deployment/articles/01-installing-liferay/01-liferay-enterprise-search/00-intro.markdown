# Installing a Search Engine [](id=installing-a-search-engine)

Search engines are a critical component of your Liferay installation. They allow
you to provide documents in an index that can quickly be searched, rather than
relying on expensive database queries. For more fundamental material on search
and indexing in Liferay, read
[here](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-liferay-search).
If you're here, you probably know the basics already and want to get started on
configuring a search engine for your Liferay enterprise deployment. 

Liferay ships with Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine.
Elasticsearch is well supported and will almost certainly meet any search and
indexing need you have. For deployment settings, learn to configure a
standalone, or remote, Elasticsearch server or cluster
[here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-elasticsearch-for-liferay-0).

If you need to use Solr, it's also supported in Liferay, and you can read more
about its configuration [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-solr).
