# Managing Liferay with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets 
you manage and monitor your Liferay DXP instances. LCS can automatically install 
the fix packs that you choose, monitor your DXP instances' performance, activate 
your DXP instances, and help you manage your DXP subscriptions. In other words, 
LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is Liferay DXP. Even better, the 
features of LCS work regardless of whether your DXP instance is on a single 
discreet server or distributed across a node. It's like having a single butler 
that can serve several mansions at once! You can find more information 
about LCS on its 
[official product page](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-connected-services). 

Before going any further, you should take note of a few key terms used 
throughout this guide: 

- *Project*: Represents a group of users belonging to a company or organization. 
  For example, a project can consist of all the users from a project team or 
  business unit, or it can include the entire company.
- *Environment*: Represents a physical cluster of servers or a virtual or 
  logical aggregation of servers.
- *Server*: Describes a concrete DXP instance. It can be a standalone server 
  or a cluster node.

As you go through this guide, you'll cover the following topics: 

- Patching Tool Configuration 
- Connecting and Activating Your Liferay DXP Instances with LCS 
- Using LCS 

You'll get started with a few configuration steps that are required to use LCS 
with your Liferay DXP instances.

# Activating Your DXP Server with LCS [](id=registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs)

Once the LCS client app is deployed, you're ready to activate your DXP server 
with LCS. You'll use an 
[LCS environment token](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens) 
to do this: 

1. Log in to 
   [lcs.liferay.com](https://lcs.liferay.com). This takes you to your company's 
   LCS project. If your company has multiple projects, select the one you want 
   to activate this server under from the user menu at the top right.

    ![Figure 1: Your company's LCS projects are shown under *Manage Projects* in your user menu.](../../../../images-dxp/lcs-user-menu-manage-projects.png)

2. Ensure that an environment exists to activate your server under. If you have 
   sufficient permissions in your company's project, you can create a new 
   environment by selecting the *Add Environment* tab. Note that you must 
   activate a clustered server in a clustered environment. LCS environments can 
   only be designated as clustered when they are created. To create a clustered 
   environment, click *Add Environment* and select the *Cluster* checkbox when 
   filling out the environment's information. Note that you must set the portal 
   property `cluster.link.enabled` to `true` in any servers that connect to a 
   clustered environment. 

    ![Figure 2: You must activate your DXP server in an LCS environment. The red box in this screenshot highlights an environment.](../../../../images-dxp/lcs-registration-select-environment.png)

3. Select the *Subscriptions* tab, and check the *Assign Subscription Type* 
   table to ensure that the environment you want to activate your server in has 
   a subscription type. If the environment doesn't have a subscription type, you 
   can assign it one by selecting the *No Subscriptions* link and then choosing 
   a subscription type. You should **use caution** when setting an environment's 
   subscription type. All the servers in an environment **must be shut down** to 
   assign that environment's subscription type. Also, **once set, you can't 
   change an environment's subscription type**. 
   [Click here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions) 
   for more information on using subscriptions in LCS. 

    ![Figure 3: The Environment Subscriptions table shows the subscription types assigned to your environments, and lets you make such assignments.](../../../../images-dxp/lcs-environment-subscriptions.png)

4. Select the environment you want to activate the server under, and then select 
   the *Registration* tab. This tab is where you can download and manage the 
   environment's token. In the Registration tab's *Services* section, first 
   select the LCS services that you want to use with all DXP servers that 
   connect to this environment. All services are selected by default. Your 
   selections of LCS services here are embedded in the token file. 

    ![Figure 4: An environment's Registration tab lets you manage the token file used to connect DXP instances to the environment.](../../../../images-dxp/lcs-registration.png) 

5. Now you must use the Registration tab to generate, regenerate, and/or 
   download the token file. The actions you take here depend on two things: what 
   you did in the previous step and whether the environment has a token file 
   already. Note that if the environment already has a token file, the Generate 
   Token button is replaced by the Download Token button: 

    - **No existing token file:** Generate the token by clicking *Generate 
      Token*. 
    - **Existing token file, and changed selections of LCS services:** 
      Regenerate the token by clicking *Regenerate Token*. Note that if you 
      regenerate the token, all DXP servers that currently use it will be 
      disconnected from LCS and won't be able to reconnect until receiving the 
      new token. 
    - **Existing token file, and no changes to selections of LCS services:** No 
      token generation or regeneration is required.

    Once you've taken the appropriate action, download the token file by 
    clicking the *Download Token* button at the bottom of the screen. 
    [Click here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens) 
    for more information on environment tokens.

6. Shut down your DXP instance if it's running. Place the token file in your 
   instance's `[Liferay_Home]/data` folder, and then start the instance. On 
   startup, the LCS client app uses the environment token to activate your DXP 
   instance in the LCS environment that corresponds to the token. 

7. Celebrate! Your DXP server is activated and connected to LCS. 

In your DXP instance, you can view your LCS connection status in the LCS client 
app. Access the client by clicking *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; 
*Liferay Connected Services*. Note that you can change which LCS services are 
enabled for your DXP instance by clicking the *Configure Services* link. 

Here's a full description of what a connected LCS client app displays: 

- **Connection Uptime:** The duration of the client's connection with LCS.
- **Last Message Received:** The time the latest message was received from LCS.
- **Services:** The LCS services enabled for this DXP instance. Note that all 
  DXP instances that connect to the same LCS environment must use the same set 
  of LCS services. LCS services can't be enabled on an instance-by-instance 
  basis. 
- **Project Home:** This link takes you to this server's LCS project. 
  The project home in LCS is also called the *dashboard*. 
- **Environment:** This link takes you to this server's LCS environment.
- **Server Dashboard:** This link takes you to the server on LCS.

Awesome! Now you know how to use environment tokens in LCS to activate your DXP 
server.
