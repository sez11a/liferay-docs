# Installing @product@

As @product@ is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application server,
you can use your application server's deployment tools to install Liferay. If
you don't already have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured
application servers with Liferay already installed on them. They're easy to 
install and with a small amount of configuration can be made into 
production-ready systems.

Read on to learn how you can prepare to install @product@.
