#### Activating Liferay DXP ####


Liferay now offers a new way of registering its products. Beginning with Liferay DXP, activation keys are now managed through a new portlet called _Liferay Connected Services_ (LCS for short). Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets administrators manage and monitor their Liferay DXP instances. LCS can automatically install fix packs, monitor each Liferay DXP instance's performance, [activate each Liferay DXP instance](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/licensing-your-dxp-server), and help manage Liferay DXP subscriptions.

To start using Liferay DXP, each instance must be associated with the subscriptions which is done on LCS. For more information, go to: [Managing Liferay DXP with LCS](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services).
