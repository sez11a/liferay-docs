# @product@ deployment

@product@ is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
respect to database and application server support. Liferay supports a wide
variety of databases and application servers, freeing you to use the ones you
think are best. @product@ also scales very well. You can install @product@ on a
shared hosting account, on a multi-node cluster running a commercial application
server, or on anything in between. In fact, Liferay is used successfully in all
of these scenarios every day.
