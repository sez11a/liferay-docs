# Upgrading to Elasticsearch 6 [](id=upgrading-to-elasticsearch-6)

Elasticsearch 6 is supported for Digital Enterprise subscribers running Fix Pack
42 or later and for Community Edition users running 7.0 CE GA 6 or greater. If
you're not already running a remote Elasticsearch 2.x server, follow the 
[installation guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-elasticsearch) 
to install Elasticsearch 6 and the 
[configuration guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-elasticsearch-for-liferay-0) 
to configure the Elasticsearch adapter. Here, you'll learn to upgrade an
existing Elasticsearch 2.x server (or cluster) to Elasticsearch 6.1.x: 

1.  Install and configure Elasticsearch 6.1.x.

3.  Download the Elasticsearch 6 adapter from 
    [Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace).

4.  Stop the default Elasticsearch adapter.

5.  Stop the Elasticsearch 2.4 server.

6.  Start Elasticsearch 6.

7.  Install and configure the Elasticsearch 6 adapter.

8.  Re-index all search indexes.

**Before Proceeding:** Back up your existing data before upgrading
Elasticsearch. If something goes wrong during or after the upgrade, roll
back to 2.x using the uncorrupted index snapshots. See
[here](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/backing-up-elasticsearch)
for more information.

**Key Changes:** This list compiles known changes within Elasticsearch that are
likely to affect @product@ users. For a more complete reckoning of what's
changed in Elasticsearch, see the 
[breaking changes for Elasticsearch 6](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/breaking-changes.html),
and 
[Elasticsearch 5](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking-changes-5.0.html),
since the breaking changes from 2.x to 5.x also apply to 2.x to 6.1.

*Custom Mappings*

**Aggregations:** Aggregating on analyzed `String` fields was possible in
Elasticsearch 2.x, but aggregating on analyzed `text` fields is not advised
in Elasticsearch 6.1. Instead, use a `keyword` field or add 
[field data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/fielddata.html).
Beware; `fielddata` is disabled by default because it is memory-intensive.

*Spell Check and Query Suggestions*

Due to Elastic's 
[removal of mapping types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/removal-of-types.html)
from search documents, spell check indexes and suggestion dictionaries now
use a single document type. If your installation was leveraging either
functionality, you must re-index all spell check indexes (form Control Panel
&rarr; Configuration &rarr; Server Administration).

## Installing Elasticsearch 6.1 [](id=installing-elasticsearch-6-1)

1.  Download 
    [Elasticsearch 6.1.x](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases)
    and unzip it wherever you please.

2.  Name the cluster by configuring the `cluster.name` property in
    `elasticsearch.yml`:

        cluster.name: LiferayElasticsearchCluster

3.  Install the following required Elasticsearch plugins:

    -  `analysis-icu`
    -  `analysis-kuromoji`
    -  `analysis-smartcn`
    -  `analysis-stempel`

4.  To install these plugins, navigate to Elasticsearch Home and enter

        ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install [plugin-name]

5.  Replace *[plugin-name]* with the Elasticsearch plugin's name.

6.  Once installed, start Elasticsearch 6 by running

        ./bin/elasticsearch

    from Elasticsearch Home.

## Download the Elasticsearch 6 Adapter [](id=download-the-elasticsearch-6-adapter)

Download the 
[Elasticsearch 6 adapter LPKG from Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace).

## Stop the Elasticsearch Adapter and Elasticsearch 2.x [](id=stop-the-elasticsearch-adapter-and-elasticsearch-2-x)

Before installing the Elasticsearch 6 adapter, you must stop the running
Elasticsearch adapter that ships with @product@. Use the App Manager: 

1.  Navigate to Control Panel &rarr; Apps &rarr; App Manager.

2.  Search for *elasticsearch*. Find the Liferay Portal Search Elasticsearch
    module and click the *edit* ((![Edit](../../images/icon-edit.png))) button.
    Choose the *Deactivate* option. This leaves the bundle installed, but stops
    it in the OSGi runtime.

3.  If you're using the Shield and Marvel integration plugins, make sure you
    uninstall those, too.

Alternatively, 
[blacklist](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blacklisting-osgi-modules) 
the Elasticsearch, Shield, and Marvel plugins. Create a 

    com.liferay.portal.bundle.blacklist.internal.BundleBlacklistConfiguration.config

file with these contents:

    blacklistBundleSymbolicNames=["com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch",
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.shield",
        "com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.marvel.web"]

Place the file in `Liferay Home/osgi/configs`.

Then stop Elasticsearch 2.x. If you're wondering whether your log should be
complaining vociferously at this point, the answer is a definitive *yes*. You'll
resolve that in the next step.

## Install and Configure the Elasticsearch 6 Adapter [](id=install-and-configure-the-elasticsearch-6-adapter)

Once the default adapter is stopped, install the Elasticsearch 6 adapter (the
LPKG you downloaded) by placing it in your Liferay Home folder's `deploy`
folder.
See 
[here](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-apps-manually#using-your-file-system-to-install-apps)
for more information.

<!--It starts automatically with log messages like this:

Add when possible -->
Now configure the adapter to find your Elasticsearch 6.1.x cluster by specifying
the correct *Cluster Name* and setting *Operation Mode* to *REMOTE*. Make sure
the *Transport Address* matches the one Elasticsearch is using. If testing
locally with Elasticsearch's default settings, the default value in the adapter
works fine (*localhost:9300*).

## Reindex [](id=reindex)

Once the Elasticsearch adapter is installed and talking to the Elasticsearch
cluster, navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Server
Administration*, and click *Execute* for the *Reindex all search indexes* entry.

You should also re-index the spell check indexes while you're here.

## Reverting to Elasticsearch 2 [](id=reverting-to-elasticsearch-2)

Stuff happens. If that stuff involves an unrecoverable failure during the
upgrade to Elasticsearch 6, roll back to Elasticsearch 2 and regroup.

Since Elasticsearch 2 and Elasticsearch 6 are two separate installations, this
procedure is straightforward:

1.  Stop and remove the Elasticsearch 6 adapter.

2.  Reinstall the Elasticsearch 2 adapter.

3.  Make sure that `elasticsearch.yml` and the Elasticsearch 2 adapter's configuration
    are configured to use the same port (9200 by default).
