# Getting Started [](id=getting-started)

Once you have installed @commerce@ from
[Marketplace](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-liferay-marketplace),
the app's features are enabled and ready to go.

Most of @commerce@'s features can be found in the Commerce Menu, and if what you
want is to start setting up a web store from scratch, then that's exactly where
you should go. But many users--especially new users--will find it easier to
start off by deploying a starter kit instead.

A starter kit is simply a site template that includes the backbone of what
a functioning web store needs: a catalog populated with sample items, product
display pages, a working checkout procedure, etc.

To activate a starter kit, go to the control panel and create a new site. When
prompted to choose a site template (for more information, see 
[site templates]( /discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/building-sites-from-templates))
select one of the commerce templates.

![Figure 1: *Customer Portal* and *Lotus* are both commerce templates.](../images/starter-kits.png)

At the time of this writing, there are two commerce templates. *Customer Portal*
models a typical B2B use case, while *Lotus* is a B2C retailer.

Now we're moving. The next section covers the most important aspect of any
store: the catalog and the products it holds.

<!--Starter kits need to go into separate document. This section should mainly be an overview of commerce features. Starter kits should only be touched on, and don't call them starter kits. They're site templates now.

For commerce features, use the top-level categories in the outline. Roughly; "settings" isn't a feature. For material, look to the introductions that you've already written to each section.
