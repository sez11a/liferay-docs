# Restrictions [](id=restrictions)

No matter what shipping methods you use, you have the option to apply
restrictions. A restriction will make a shipping method unavailable for
shipments to selected countries or regions. To apply a restriction, go to
a shipping method and click on the *Restrictions* tab. Then click the
![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and select whatever countries or regions
you want to restrict.
