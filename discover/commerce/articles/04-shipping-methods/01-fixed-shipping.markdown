# Fixed Shipping Method [](id=fixed-shipping-method)

A fixed rate shipping method is the easiest to set up, but does not offer any
option to vary shipping costs by product automatically (although you can
manually set a shipping adjustment for select products in the catalog: see
[link]).

## Details [](id=details)

To enter a fixed shipping method, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr;
*Settings* and click on the *Shipping Methods* tab and the *Fixed*. This opens
the shipping methods *details* tab, which contains the following fields:

    - Name: The default name for the fixed shipping method is *Fixed*. This name
    cannot ordinarily be seen by customers, but depending on what customizations are in use
    it may make sense to change it.

    - Description: This is not used by default, but can be displayed to the
    product page or the checkout page via customization.

    - Image: an image uploaded to the field will be displayed in checkout page
    when the user selects shipping options.

The *Active* box must be checked for the fixed shipping method to be displayed
to customers. Enter a priority to determine the order in which shipping methods
will be displayed on a page.

## Shipping Options [](id=shipping-options)

Activating Fixed Shipping will have no effect if no Shipping options have been
defined. For most users, it makes sense to define a number of different options,
so that customers can choose between low-cost and high-speed shipping.

To create a new shipping option, first open the *Fixed* shipping method and then
click on the *Shipping Option* tab. The following dialog box appears:

![Figure 1: Setting up a new shipping option is a simple matter describing the option and setting a price.](../../images/fixed-shipping-option.png)

Fill in these fields:

    - Name: The option should have an informative title, as it will be
    selectable by customers.

    - Description: Pertinent information on the option (delivery time, any
    guarantees) should go in this field.

    - Amount: Sets the price for this option.
    
    - Priority: Sets the order in which options will be displayed. Lower numbers
    come first.

Click *Save* and you're set. Customers will be able to ship any item in your
catalog for the price you just entered. The follow sections cover more flexible options.
