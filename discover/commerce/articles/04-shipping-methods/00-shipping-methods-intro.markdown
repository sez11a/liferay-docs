# Shipping Methods [](id=shipping-methods)

If your customers are like me, they'll always be happy with the cheapest
shipping you offer. Free shipping takes six weeks? Better plan ahead, 'cause
free shipping is free shipping.

Of course, most of your customers are probably not like me, and are willing to
pay a modest fee to receive their goods in a more timely fashion. At the same
time, you have your own needs to consider. Some products cost extra to ship due
to size or weight, and some may face complications when shipping across national
borders. To meet everyone's requirements, you probably need to set up your web
store with a number of different shipping options.

There are three ways to set up shipping options.

**Fixed Rate** shipping applies the same price to every product in the catalog.

**By Weight** shipping allows you to set up a formula to calculate a unique rate
for each order, on the basis of weight, product price, or other factors.

**By Carrier** shipping allows you align your shipping processes closely with
those of a particular shipping company. This can help ensure that the prices you
charge your customers closely match your actual shipping costs. Out of the box,
@commerce@ offers an option to assist in integration with FedEx, but can be
customized to integrate with another carrier instead.

The follow sections describe how to implement these options.
