# FedEx Shipping [](id=fedex-shipping)

As an alternative to either fixed-rate or by-weight shipping, users can
integrate closely with a courier service. Out of the box, @commerce@ is prepared
to integrate with FedEx, but can be customized to work with any other company
[link].

Integration with a courier can give customers more control over how their orders
are shipped, and can also help sellers align the shipping costs they charge more
closely with the costs they actually pay.

To set up FedEx shipping, go to the *Shipping Methods* tab in *Settings* and
select the *FedEx* option. This takes you to the *details* tab, which works just
like those in Fixed [link] and By Weight [link] shipping. Once you entered the
pertinent details, click on the *Configuration* tab and the following fields are
displayed:

**URL**:

**Key**:

**Password**:

**Account Number**:

**Meter Number**:

**Dropoff Type**: You'll want to make arrangements with a FedEx office local to
your warehouse before making a selection from the drop-down box. <!--why does
commerce need this information anyway?>-->

**Residential and Discounted Rates**:

**Service Types**: FedEx offers a variety of shipping services, but you might
not want to support all of them. Check the box next to each option
you want to offer your customers.

**Packing Type**: 

**Max Weight and Height**: This shipping method will only be available for
products smaller and lighter than the limits set in these fields. See [link] on
how to product weight and dimensions.
