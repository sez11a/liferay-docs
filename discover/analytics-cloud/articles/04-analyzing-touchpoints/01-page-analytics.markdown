# Understanding Page Analytics [](id=understanding-page-analytics)

How are your Site Pages performing? Do you know if visitors are abandoning
your site when they hit a certain Page, or if one Page is constantly getting
views, engaging users, and drawing visitors back to your site? 

If you're familiar with page analytics in some other product, you'll be right at
home in Analytics Cloud. 

What are Pages in Liferay Analytics Cloud? Pages are:

- Pages on a website.
- Registered and tracked by the Analytics Cloud server for analysis the first
    time a Page interaction is detected by the Analytics Cloud client.
- Queried on a schedule for up-to-date data.
- Reported on in Analytics Cloud with the metrics and reports shown in this
    article.

Readers of this article want to understand their Pages' performance. They
already have an understanding of what Analytics Cloud is and want to understand
its Page metrics and how to interpret the data. They're ready to understand and
act on their Pages' data.

## Data Time Periods [](id=data-time-periods)

All Pages data in Analytics Cloud is displayed for a specified time period. The
time period selector recalculates the metrics based on the time period selected.
You must specify a time period for which you'd like to view the metrics. The
default is 30 days, but this is configurable. The following values are
supported:

- Last 24 hours
- Yesterday
- Last 7 days
- Last 28 days
- Last 30 days (default)
- Last 90 days

## Visitor Behavior [](id=visitor-behavior)

The Overview tab of a Page's metrics has several data presentations.  The first
chart, called Visitor Behavior, is paramount. It contains four important
metrics:

- Average Engagement Score
- Total Visitors
- Total Views
- Bounce Rate
- Average Time on Page

![Figure 1: The Visitors Behavior chart contains interesting rend lines.](../../images/pages-visitors-behavior.png)

Select the time period of the data displayed. There are always two trend lines
displayed: Selected Period and Previous Period. This facilitates comparisons
between time periods. 

<!-- REMOVING INTERPRETIVE ANALYSIS FOR NOW: If the Views are dropping over the selected time period, you might be concerned
about the health of the Page. However, if you see that they're still
higher than they were at any point during the previous time period, perhaps it
puts the current data in context. -->

So what are these metrics in the Visitor Behavior chart?

### Metric: Engagement [](id=metric-engagement)

Engagement, or average Page Engagement is an aggregation of metrics into one
overall score. It incorporates these factors:

- Depth of scroll on the Page
- Number of clicks
- Time spent on the Page
- More!

Use the engagement score as a high level view of the Page's overall performance,
as compared with other Pages. It might not tell you specifically what's so
effective (or weak) about a Page, but it can tell you if the Page is performing
as desired over the selected time period.

<!-- Remove since most likely not sensible to non-US readers. Keeping for now in
case there's some other analogy that might be more universal. -->

**Baseball Analogy:** Are you a baseball fan? If so you're probably familiar
with the classic individual metrics used to describe a non-pitcher's
proficiency: Batting Average, Slugging Percentage, Fielding Percentage, and a
few more. Now there are higher level aggregation metrics used to evaluate
baseball players, such as BABIP (Batting Average on Balls In Play) and WAR (Wins
Above Replacement). Discussion of those metrics is not the point here. Think of
the simpler metrics offered by Analytics Cloud (Views, Visitors, Time on Page)
as single snapshots into how useful a Page is, like looking at Batting
Average and Fielding Percentage to evaluate baseball players. Think of
Page Engagement as an advanced aggregation metric that captures the
overall usefulness of a Page, similar to BABIP or WAR in baseball. Maybe
the Analytics team can come up with a WAR-like metric next, to compare how
valuable a Page is as compared with the average Page. It could be
called TEAR (Page Engagement Above Replacement).

$$$-->

Page Engagement is useful to combine with time period filtering and comparative
time period features. Comparing the engagement score from different periods is
the best way to determine how your Page's performance changes over time.

### Metric: Page Visitors [](id=metric-page-visitors)

Useful with the time period filter, Page Visitors is the number of
visitors that accessed a Page in a given period of time.

A unique visitor has a unique IP address <!--need more info on how unique
visitors are calculated--> in Analytics cloud. Therefore, if the same human
being hits the Page from a different device, it's logged as a unique
visitor to the Page.

### Metric: Page Views [](id=metric-page-views)

Useful with the time period filter, Page View is the number of views for a Page
Page in a given period of time. It's not the same as the number of visitors,
because it doesn't try to count only unique IP addresses. So over the last 30
days, one visitor (IP address) could come back to the Page 100 times. That means
there are 100 Page Views, but only one visitor (assuming they used the same
machine to access the Page each time.  However, a unique view won't be logged
for a single user unless at least 30 minutes of inactivity <!-- need info on
whether 30 minutes is accurate and that this is how views are calculated--> on
the Page passes before the user interacts with the Page again.

### Metric: Page Bounce Rate [](id=metric-page-bounce-rate)

Bounce Rate is the percentage of visitors to the Page that navigated away from
the site without any page interaction (including scrolling on the page) after
the initial page load. It's calculated as a daily rate (percentage per day), and
the daily rate trend line is displayed over the selected time period. 

### Metric: Average Time on Page [](id=metric-average-time-on-page)

Time on Page calculates the average time spent on a Page for all the Views each
day. It's displayed for the selected time period.

This metric is calculated like this for each 24 hour period:

    (view-1-time + view-2-time + ...) / total-number-views

That concludes the Visitors Behavior chart, but there's more Page data to look
at. Just scroll down a little bit.

## Views by Segment [](id=views-by-segment)

Segments are created by the Analytics Cloud administrator in the People &rarr;
Segments section. Segments are groups of Individuals with common
characteristics.

The Views by Segment bar graph shows how many times the Page was viewed by up to
the top seven Segments over the selected time period. If there are more than
seven Segments, the top six are displayed, and views by the remaining Segments
are aggregated in the seventh bar on the graph, labeled _X More Segments_).

![Figure 2: See which Segments are most commonly viewing the Page.](../../images/pages-views-segments.png)

## Views by Location [](id=views-by-location)

View a bubble chart to compare the views by country over the selected period. Up
to the top five countries are displayed, and the sixth bubble is an aggregation
of the remaining countries.

![Figure 3: See where the Page is most popular.](../../images/pages-views-location.png)

## Views by Technology [](id=views-by-technology)

View a stacked bar graph of the Page's views by operating system (grouped by
device type) in the default tab. Hover over each bar to see the detailed
breakdown of data.

![Figure 4: Which OS is most commonly being used to access the Page?](../../images/pages-views-os.png)

Click *Web Browser* to see a donut chart displaying up to the top eight web
browsers over the selected time period. If applicable, remaining web borwsers
are aggregated in the ninth donut segment.

![Figure 5: Which browser should your page be optimized for?](../../images/pages-views-browser.png)

## Assets [](id=assets)

View a list of the Assets on the Page by their number of Interactions
over the selected time period.

Depending on the Asset being viewed, a different Interaction metric is reported
on:

- Blogs reports Views.
- Documents and Media reports Downloads.
- Forms reports Submissions.
- Web Content reports Views.

![Figure 6: Which Assets on the Page are getting the most interactions?](../../images/pages-assets.png)
