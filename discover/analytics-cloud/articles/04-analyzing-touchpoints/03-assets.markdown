# Assets: Analyzing Content [](id=assets-analyzing-content)

Assets are individual pieces of content that exist on Site Pages in your Liferay
Analytics Cloud data sources. In summary, Assets are:

- Content residing on a Page.
- Registered, tracked, and reported on by Analytics Cloud the first time an
    interaction is detected by the Analytics Cloud client.
- Queried and reported on at regular intervals.
- Reported on in Analytics Cloud with the data reports shown in this article.

Metrics for these Assets are currently reported in Analytics Cloud:

- [Forms](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/forms)
- [Blogs](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-blogs)

Readers of these Assets articles have an understanding of what Analytics
Cloud is and what they want to get out of their Asset data. They are here to

interpret the data and configure its views for easiest consumption.
