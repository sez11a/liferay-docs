# Form Notifications

Send a notification email each time a form entry is submitted. 

1.  Open the form's Form Settings section by clicking the *Options*
    (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) button &rarr; *Settings*). 

2.  Click the *Email Notifications* tab, enable the option to *Send an email
    notification for each entry*, and fill out the fields:

    -  From Name: The name of the sender. This could be the site name, the form,
       name, or anything else that will be informative to the recipient.
    -  From Address: You can use something like *noreply@liferay-forms.com*, so that
       recipients of the notification don't try to reply.
    -  To Address: This should be the email address of the notification recipient
       (for example, *test@liferay.com*). 
    -  Subject: An informative subject line tells the recipient what happened:
       *An application for employment was submitted in The Lunar Resort*, for
       example.

If you 
[enabled workflow for the form](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-and-forms),
and there's already a notification going to the people who need to process the
form entry, you might not need to generate any notification from the Forms
application itself.
