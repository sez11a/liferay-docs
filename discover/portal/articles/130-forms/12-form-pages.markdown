# Form Pages

Are users more likely to abandon long forms with lots of scrolling? Are they
more likely to see a multi-page form and abandon it without a second look,
assuming that it gets longer and more tedious with every passing page? Those
form usability questions are worth thinking about. If you decide multiple pages
are appropriate for your form, Liferay Forms supports two pagination styles.

Here's the default pagination style:
![Figure x: ](../../images/forms-pagination1.png)

Here's the alternate pagination style:
![Figure x: ](../../images/forms-pagination2.png)

To add a form page,

1.  Go to the builder view of a form.

2.  Click the Actions (![Action](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) button at the top right
hand corner of the form, and then click *Add New Page*.

You can also delete form pages, add 
[success pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/success-pages), 
and switch pagination modes.
