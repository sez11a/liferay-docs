# Help Text, Placeholder Text, and Predefined Values

Form fields can have help text, placeholder text and predefined values.

**Help Text**
: Helpful text that appears as a sub-heading to the field label, and doesn't
appear in the field entry area. Enter help text in the Basic tab of the field's
sidebar menu.

**Placeholder Text**
: Helpful text in the field entry area that *is not submitted* if the field is left
untouched by the User.

**Predefined Value**
: A value that's presented to the User in the field entry area, and *is
submitted* if the field is left untouched by the User.

All form field types can have Help Text, and all form field types that accept User
input can have predefined values. Only Text Fields and Numeric Fields can have
placeholder text.

To enter placeholder text or predefined values, 

1.  Open a field's sidebar menu.

2.  Open the Properties tab.

A lot of forms start a Full Name field. Some Users might be concerned that you
don't really want their full name. Use placeholder text to show them that no
matter how long their name is, you want the whole thing. By contrast, if you're
asking form Users to specify how many sandwiches they need for lunch, a
predefined value of *1* probably makes sense.

Remember that placeholder values will not be submitted if the field is left
blank, so you don't have to worry about getting a bunch of submissions from
