# Styling Form Pages

Use form rows and columns to save vertical space and make the form
user-friendly. 

A separate article shows you how to use 
[form pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/form-pages).
This article shows you how to lay out those pages.

Two features are available for creating form layouts:

1.  Create rows and columns for form fields.
2.  Move fields from one location to another.

Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to have a single column, vertically oriented
form, which is what you get by default when you just keep dragging form fields
onto the form.

Instead, you might use more than one column in your form.

The multi-column approach saves a lot of space. You can also use a mixed
approach, with each row broken into a different number of columns.

If you've added a field to the form, you've added a row. By default, dragging a
field onto the form page adds a field that occupies the entire row. Resize the
field to make room for more fields in the row (columns).

1.  Hover over the field, and its borders are revealed:

2.  Drag the right or left edge of the field to resize it.

3.  Add a new field to the space left in the row.

    ![Figure x: Another field occupies the remaining space.](../../images/form-field-columns.png)

In addition to resizing fields to create columns, you can move fields around on
a page.

1.  Hover over the field, and the cursor becomes a hand.

2.  Drag the field to an open location in the builder. Available locations are
    highlighted in blue with a dotted line outline.

    Moving the field to a new row automatically makes the form take up the
    entire row. 

    Moving the field to an opening in an existing row makes the field fill the
    remaining space in the row.

Move fields and arrange them in rows and columns to enhance the look of your
form.

<!-- None of the below seems to be applicable in 7.1 -->
<!-- NA If you'd like, you can design your forms before you add the fields. Just start
resizing the row using the form layout functionality (drag the chevrons to
resize the field slots, or columns, in a row). As you make a field slot smaller, the new
space is taken up by another field slot. You'll end by having divided the row
into two columns. Resizing again will make three columns. Once you have the row
situated how you'd like, start adding the form fields.

<!-- NA You can also cut entire rows from the form and paste them elsewhere. Any fields
you added and configured will be pasted with the field. Once you click the cut
icon (the scissors), you'll be alerted to the available positions where you can
paste the row and its fields.

Did you notice the delete icon (![Trash](../../images/icon-trash.png))?
Clicking it deletes the entire row, with all its fields. 

Just like you can cut and paste an entire row, you can move an individual field
to any unoccupied field slot, in any row. Just open the field's actions menu by
clicking the Actions button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)),
which will appear when you hover your mouse over the field in the layout.

In addition to moving the field, you can edit the field or delete it.

**Note:** If you're following along with the employment application form, it's
time to build the second page of the form (Very Personal Details). Combining
your form building knowledge with your ability to customize the form layout,
build the form to match the screenshot below. It will use form text, date,
single selection, text, and single checkbox (multiple selection on Liferay
Portal CE) fields, laid out in two columns.

Now it's done. Your users, including Guest users, can submit applications to The
Lunar Resort. The form is multi-page, full of features, and there's even some
processing that's done on form submission. As you can see, there's a lot of
flexibility built in to Liferay's Forms application.
