# Redirecting Users

Send users to any URL you want upon form submission. You might have a particular
*Thanks for your submission!* type page with a link to the home page, or you
might want to direct a user somewhere specific based on the form they just
submitted. Sometimes all you need is a 
[success page in the form itself](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/success-pages),
but other times you'll want.

Whatever your use case is, set up a redirect URL by 

1.  Opening the form's
Form Settings section (click the *Options*
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) button &rarr; *Settings*). 

2.  In the *Redirect URL* just type the URL. That's it.

Now when Users submit the form, they're not left wondering what to do next.
