# Duplicating Forms and Form Fields

Duplicating effort is bad. It wastes your precious time and increases the
likelihood that something won't be perfectly replicated. Instead of duplicating
effort, duplicate forms and form fields.

To duplicate a form,

1.  Go to the Site Menu &rarr; Content &rarr; Forms.

2.  Click the Actions button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for
    the form to duplicate.

3.  Click *Duplicate*.

The form is duplicated and automatically named *Copy of [Original Form Name]*.
Once duplicated, you can edit the form however you need to. When you duplicate a
form, all configurations and Form Rules are duplicated as well.

To duplicate a form field,

1.  Go to the Site Menu &rarr; Content &rarr; Forms, and open a form, or add
    one.

2.  In the Builder view, hover over the form field to duplicate, and click the
    Copy icon (![Copy](../../../images/icon-copy.png)).

![Figure x: The Duplicate option works the same for forms and form fields.](../../images/forms-duplicate-form-field.png)

The field is duplicated and labeled *Copy of [Original Field Label]*. Al the
form's properties, including its data provider configurations, are copied as
well.

Form and Form Field duplication saves time and effort.
