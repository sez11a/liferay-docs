# Enabling CAPTCHA on Form Submissions

You're probably familiar with CAPTCHA, the program used to prevent a bot from
submitting forms. It's often used in 
[login applications](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/logging-into-liferay),
but you can use it in the Forms application, too. 

![Figure 12: You can enable CAPTCHA for your form in the Form Settings window.](../../images/forms-settings-captcha.png)

To enable CAPTCHA, click the form's *Options*
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) button, then *Settings*. Enable the
*Require CAPTCHA* setting, click *Done*, save the form, and that's all there is
to it!

Now, you're much more likely to receive form submissions from humans!
