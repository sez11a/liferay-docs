# Managing and Configuring Apps [](id=managing-and-configuring-apps)

@product@ is a platform for deploying apps that comprise modules and components.
It has conveniences for managing apps and app management best practices for
maximizing stability.
[Best practices in production environments](#managing-apps-in-production)
involve stopping the server before applying changes, but in cases where this
isn't feasible, you can "hot deploy" changes several different ways.

There are two places in the Control Panel where you can manage and configure 
apps: the
[App Manager](#using-the-app-manager)
and the
[Components listing](#using-the-components-listing).
The App Manager manages apps in the OSGi framework. You can use the App Manager
to install, activate, deactivate, and delete apps. You can manage apps at the
app suite, app, and OSGi module levels. 

The Components listing views and manages apps at the OSGi component level. It
differs from the App Manager by showing apps by type (portlet, theme, and layout
template), and setting app permissions. You can use the Components listing to
activate and deactivate apps, but it can't install or delete apps.

Start with learning app management best practices in production, or wherever you
want to maximize stability. 

## Managing Apps in Production [](id=managing-apps-in-production)

Not all apps are designed to be "hot deployed"---deployed while the server is
running. Deploying that way can cause instabilities, such as class loading leaks
and memory leaks. On production systems, avoid "hot deploying" apps and
configurations whenever possible.

If you're installing an app or a component configuration on a production system
and stopping the server is feasible, follow these steps: 

1.  Stop your server.

2.  Copy your app (`.lpkg`, module `.jar`, or plugin `.war`) to your `[Liferay 
Home]/deploy` folder, or copy your component configuration (`.config` file) to
the `[Liferay Home]/osgi/configs` folder. The
[Liferay Home](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-liferay#liferay-home)
folder is typically the app server's parent folder. 

3.  Start your server. 

If you're running in cluster, follow the instructions for
[updating a cluster](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/updating-a-cluster).

**Warning:** Avoid repeatedly "hot deploying" new versions of apps that aren't 
designed for "hot deployment".

If it's not feasible to stop your server or you're app *is* designed for "hot
deployment", @product@ provides several "hot deployment" conveniences. Except
where stopping/starting the server is explicitly mentioned, the practices
described in the rest of this article and in the following articles involve "hot
deployment". 

## Using the App Manager [](id=using-the-app-manager)

Access the App Manager by selecting *Control Panel* &rarr; *Apps* &rarr; *App 
Manager*. The App Manager lists app suites and apps in separate tables. The bar
above the first table configures the display of both by category, status, or
title. Click the up or down arrows to perform an ascending or descending sort,
respectively. To search for an app suite, app, or module, use the search bar at
the top-right. This is often the quickest way to find something. 

![Figure 1: The App Manager lets you manage the app suites and apps installed in your @product@ instance.](../../images/app-manager.png)

Each item listed in the tables contains a description (if available), version, 
and status. The status refers to the item's OSGi status:

-   **Installed:** The item is installed in the OSGi framework. 
-   **Resolved:** The OSGi framework has resolved the item's dependencies. 
    Resolved items can typically be activated. Some items, however, can't be 
    activated and are intended to remain in the Resolved state (e.g., WSDD 
    modules containing SOAP web services). 
-   **Active:** The item is running in the OSGi framework. 

Clicking each item's Actions button 
(![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) brings up a menu that lets you 
activate, deactivate, or delete that item. 

To view an item's contents, click its name in the table. If you click an app 
suite, the suite's apps are listed. If you click an app, the app's modules are
listed. If you click a module, the module's components appear. The component
level is as far down as you can go in OSGi without getting into the source code.
At any level in the App Manager, a link trail appears that lets you navigate
back in the hierarchy. 

For information on using the App Manager to install an app, see the article 
[Installing Apps Manually](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-apps-manually). 

Next, you'll learn how to use the Components listing. 

## Using the Components Listing [](id=using-the-components-listing)

Access the Components listing by selecting *Control Panel* &rarr; 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Components*. The Components listing first shows a table
containing a list of installed portlets. Select the type of component to
view---portlets, themes, or layout templates---by clicking the matching tab on
top of the table. To configure a component, select its name in the table or
select *Edit* from its Actions button
(![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)). Doing either opens the same
configuration screen. 

![Figure 2: The Components listing lets you manage the portlets, themes, and layout templates installed in your @product@ instance.](../../images/components-list.png)

The configuration screen lets you view a component's module ID and plugin ID, 
activate or deactivate the component, and change the component's Add to Page 
permission. The component's module ID and plugin ID appear at the top of the 
screen. You can activate or deactivate a component by checking or unchecking the 
*Active* checkbox, respectively. To change a component's Add to Page permission 
for a role, select the role's *Change* button in the permissions table. This 
takes you to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Roles*, where you can change 
the component's permissions for the selected role.
