# Inviting Members to Your Site [](id=inviting-members-to-your-site)

You've built a new site and now you need to get the word out about it. What 
better way to get the word out about your site then to invite users to join it. 
The Invite Members app lets you to do just that!

The Invite Members app is only visible to site administrators. It allows 
administrators to send invitations to users to join the site. Clicking the 
*Invite members to this site* button brings up the interface for sending out 
invitations.

Click the plus sign next to a user or click the *Add Email Address* button to 
add a user to the invite list. Users that have already been invited but have not 
yet responded are listed with a checkmark next to their name. You can also 
invite users to the *Site Owner*, *Site Content Reviewer*, and 
*Site Administrator* roles for your site by selecting that role under the 
*Invite to Role* heading. Once you've added all the users you would like to 
invite, and selected any roles you want them to have, click the 
*Send Invitations* button to invite them.

The site invite shows up under the *Requests List* tab of the user's 
*Notifications* page. The user can then choose to *Confirm* or *Ignore* the 
invitation.

Once the user confirms the invitation, they're made a member of the site and 
assigned any roles they've been invited to.
