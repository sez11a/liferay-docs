# Managing Notifications and Requests [](id=managing-notifications-and-requests)

Have you subscribed to a blog, message board, or another piece of content? Has 
someone mentioned you in a post, or sent you a private message, invitation, or 
an event reminder? If so, you've received a notification or request.

The notifications icon on your profile image displays how many unread 
notifications and requests you have.

To access notifications and requests, you can either click the notifications 
icon on your user profile image, or open the Control Menu and select 
*My Account* &rarr; *Notifications* under the user menu. The 
*Notifications List* section is selected by default. This is where all your 
notifications are displayed. Click the *Requests List* link in the navbar to 
view and manage your requests.

## Managing Notifications [](id=managing-notifications)

Notifications can start to pile up after some time, especially if you've been 
away for a few days. Since Liferay DXP Fix Pack 30 and Liferay Portal 7.0 CE GA5, 
the Management Bar gives you several ways to filter and sort your notifications. 

The following filters are available for notifications:

**All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications.
**Unread:** displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread 
notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the 
notification.
**Read:** displays notifications that have been marked as read

You can also sort your notifications by *Date*. By default notifications are 
listed by date in descending order. Click the up arrow icon in the management 
bar to sort notifications by ascending order instead. The down arrow icon lets 
you sort notifications by descending order. 

To mark a notification as read, select *Mark as read* from the actions menu for 
the notification. Select the *Mark as unread* action for a notification to set 
the type back to unread. Select the *Delete* action to permanently delete the 
notification.

### Managing Multiple Notifications [](id=managing-multiple-notifications)

You can also manage multiple notifications at once. Select the checkbox next to 
each notification that you want to manage and choose an option from the 
Management Bar. Select the checkbox above the notifications list to select all 
notifications on the current page. Selected notifications are indicated with a 
blue border along the bottom of the notification. When one or more notifications 
is selected, three actions appear above the notifications list: An open envelope 
button (![Open Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-open.png)), which 
marks the selected notifications as read; a closed envelope button 
(![Closed Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-closed.png)), which marks the 
selected notifications as unread; and an x button 
(![Delete Button](../../../images/button-delete.png)), which permanently deletes 
the selected notifications.

You can mark all notifications as read by selecting the 
*Mark all notifications as read* action in the app's actions menu.

**Note:** This feature is only available if at least one notification is unread. 
This feature marks all notifications as read, whether or not they are currently 
selected.

$$$

**This action can not be undone.** You must manually paginate through all 
the notifications and either bulk mark them as unread for the page, or 
individually mark the notifications as unread if you wish to change the state.

## Managing Requests [](id=managing-requests)

Upon receiving a request, the request appears under the *Requests List* section. 
You then have the option to *Confirm* or *Ignore* the request. Click *Confirm* 
to accept the request, or click *Ignore* to decline the request. You can also 
permanently delete the request by choosing *Delete* in the actions menu for the 
request.
