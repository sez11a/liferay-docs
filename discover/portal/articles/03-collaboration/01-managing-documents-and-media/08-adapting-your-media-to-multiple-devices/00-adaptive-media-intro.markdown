# Adapting Your Media Across Multiple Devices [](id=adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices)

It's important for media providers to consider the differences between various 
devices (phones, laptops, tablets, etc.) when delivering content, in terms not 
only of screen size but also bandwidths and processing capabilities. 
@product@'s Adaptive Media app allows administrators to control image quality 
and dynamically adjusts uploaded media to best fit the screen being used.

**Note:** At this time, Adaptive Media only works for images included in blog 
entries and web content articles.

Adaptive Media integrates with Documents and Media, Blogs, and Web Content, 
using imagery uploaded to the these apps to generate a set of images for use on 
various screens. When the content is accessed, Adaptive Media checks the screen 
type and resolution and selects appropriate imagery. You can find the Adaptive 
Media app on 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace), 
for Liferay Portal CE 7.0 and Liferay DXP. 

In this section, you'll learn how to manage and use Adaptive Media in @product@.
