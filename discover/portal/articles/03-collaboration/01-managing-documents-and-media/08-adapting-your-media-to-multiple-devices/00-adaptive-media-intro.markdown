# Adapting Your Media Across Multiple Devices [](id=adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices)

People consume content on different devices. They browse the web on their 
tablets at school, check their favorite blogs on their phones in a coffee shop, 
or view family photos at home on their laptops or streaming devices. All these 
devices have different screen sizes, bandwidths, and processing capabilities 
that must be considered when delivering media content. @product@'s Adaptive 
Media app dynamically adjusts uploaded media to best fit the screen displaying 
that media. What's more, the app lets administrators control the image quality.

**Note:** At this time, Adaptive Media only works for images included in blog 
entries and web content articles.

Adaptive Media integrates with Documents and Media, Blogs, and Web Content. It 
analyzes and processes images uploaded to these apps, generating a set of images 
with the defined resolutions. When users read a blog entry or web content 
article that contains an image, for example, Adaptive Media checks their 
device's screen resolution and delivers the copy of the image that best fits the 
screen. Adaptive Media also ensures that high-resolution devices receive a 
high-resolution image. You can find the Adaptive Media app on 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace), 
for Liferay Portal CE 7.0 and Liferay DXP. 

In this section, you'll learn how to manage and use Adaptive Media in @product@.
