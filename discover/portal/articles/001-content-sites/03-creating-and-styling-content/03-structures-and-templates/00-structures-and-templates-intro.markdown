# Web Content Structures and Templates

In @product@, you can use *structures* and *templates* to create new web content 
types and layouts. A structure defines the type of items in your content, such 
as text, images, calendar items, checkboxes, links, and more. Structures are 
based on @product@'s forms functionality. When creating content based on a 
structure, you must fill out that structure's fields. 

A template uses a templating language to display a structure's items. This lets 
you apply styles and logic to create complex or interactive content. You can 
create templates in 
[Freemarker](http://freemarker.org/) 
or 
[Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/). 
The template can contain CSS, HTML, Javascript, and elements of the templating 
language it uses. 

Before getting started with structures and templates, you should know something 
important--you might want to sit down for this--you've actually already used 
them! Basic Web Content is a type of web content defined by a structure and a 
template. Now you'll use structures and templates to create something a little 
more intricate.
