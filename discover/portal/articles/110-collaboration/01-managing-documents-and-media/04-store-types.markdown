# Store Types [](id=store-types)

You can change the file system (the *store*) that the Documents and Media 
library uses to store files. This is configured in the `portal-ext.properties` 
file by setting the `dl.store.impl=`property. Configuring stores is covered in 
[the Document Repository Configuration guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/document-repository-configuration). 
Here, you'll consider the ramifications of different stores: 

-   **Simple File System Store:** Uses the file system (local, or a mounted 
    share) to store files. This is @product@'s default store. 

-   **Advanced File System Store:** Nests files into directories by version, for 
    faster performance and to store more files. 

-   **CMIS Store (Content Management Interoperability Services):** Uses a system 
    separate from @product@ to store files. 

-   **DBStore (Database Storage)**: Stores files in the @product@ database. The 
    file (stored as a blob) size limit is 1 GB. Use the Simple File System Store 
    or Advanced File System Store to store larger files. 

-   **S3Store (Amazon Simple Storage)**: Uses Amazon's cloud-based storage 
    solution. 

If you need to move your files from one store to another, use the migration 
utility in *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Server Administration* 
&rarr; *Data Migration*. 

## Simple File System Store [](id=using-the-file-system-store)

The Simple File System Store is @product@'s default store. It stores Documents 
and Media files on the portal server's file system (local or mounted). This 
store is heavily bound to @product@'s database. The store's default root folder 
is `[Liferay Home]/data/document_library`. You can change this via the 
`dl.store.file.system.root.dir=` property in a `portal-ext.properties` file, or 
in the Control Panel. For instructions on this, see the 
[Document Repository Configuration guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/document-repository-configuration).

The Simple File System Store is a simple file storage implementation that uses a 
local folder to store files. You can use the file system for your clustered 
configuration, but you must make sure the folder you point the store at can 
handle things like concurrent requests and file locking. You must therefore use 
a Storage Area Network or a clustered file system. 

The Simple File System Store creates a folder structure based on primary keys in 
@product@'s database. If, for example, you upload a presentation with the file 
name `workflow.odp` to a folder named `stuff`, the store creates a folder 
structure like this: 

    /companyId/folderId/numericFileEntryName/versionNumber

-   `companyId`: The site's company ID.
-   `folderId`: The ID of the Documents and Media folder containing the 
    document.
-   `numericFileEntryName`: The document's numeric file entry name.
-   `versionNumber`: The document's version number.

**Note:** Be careful not to confuse a document's numeric file entry name from 
its document ID. Each has an independent counter. The numeric file entry name is 
used in the folder path for storing the document, but the document ID is not. 
The numeric file entry name can be found in the `name` column of the 
`DLFileEntry` table in @product@'s database; the document ID can be found in the 
`fileEntryId` column of the same table.

## Using the Advanced File System Store [](id=using-the-advanced-file-system-store)

The Advanced File System Store, like the Simple File System Store, saves files 
to the local file system. It uses a slightly different folder structure, 
however, and can overcome operating system limitations on the number of files 
that can be stored in a particular folder. It overcomes this limitation by
programmatically creating a structure that can expand to millions of files, by
alphabetically nesting the files in folders. This also improves performance, as 
there are fewer files stored per folder. 

![Figure 2: The Advanced File System Store creates a more nested folder structure than the Simple File System Store.](../../../images/enterprise-adv-file-system-store.png)

The same rules apply to the Advanced File System Store as apply to the Simple 
File System Store. To cluster it, you must point the store to a network mounted 
file system that all the nodes can access. That networked file system must also 
support concurrent requests and file locking. Otherwise, you may experience data 
corruption issues if two users attempt to write to the same file at the same 
time from two different nodes. 

See the 
[Document Repository Configuration guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-advanced-file-system-store) 
for instructions on using the Advanced File System Store. 

## Using the CMIS Store [](id=using-the-cmis-store)

Though you can mount as many different CMIS (Content Management Interoperability
Services) repositories as you like in the Documents and Media library, you can 
also redefine the @product@ repository to point to a CMIS repository. This lets 
users create a folder or upload content to the that repository without the 
administrator having to mount that repository via the UI. 

+$$$

**Note:** The CMIS Store isn't suitable for production use and is deprecated as 
of Liferay Portal CE 7.0 and Liferay DXP. Because the CMIS Store can have 
performance issues with large repositories, you should a different store. This 
deprecation doesn't affect the use of external repositories. You can still 
[connect to external repositories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-external-repositories) 
using CMIS. 

$$$

When using the CMIS Store, the @product@ repository is connected to CMIS via the 
CMIS store. As long as all nodes are pointing to your CMIS repository, 
everything in your @product@ cluster should be fine, as the CMIS protocol 
prevents multiple simultaneous file access from causing data corruption. 

See the 
[Document Repository Configuration guide](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-cmis-store) 
for instructions on using the CMIS Store. 

## Using Amazon Simple Storage Service [](id=using-amazon-simple-storage-service)

Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud-based storage solution that you
can use with @product@. It lets you store your documents to the cloud seamlessly 
from all nodes. 

When you sign up for the service, Amazon assigns you unique keys that link you 
to your account. In Amazon's interface, you can create *buckets* of data 
optimized by region. Once you create these to your specifications, follow 
[these instructions](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-amazon-simple-storage-service) 
to connect your repository to @product@. 

Consult Amazon's S3 documentation for more information.
