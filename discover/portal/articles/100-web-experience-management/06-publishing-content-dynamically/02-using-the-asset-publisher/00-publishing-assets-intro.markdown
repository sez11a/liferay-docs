# Publishing Assets [](id=publishing-assets)

As you create web content, it's important to keep in mind that to @product@, the
pieces of content are assets, just like message board entries and blog posts.
This allows you to publish different kinds of content using @product@'s Asset
Publisher. You can use the Asset Publisher to publish a mixed group of various
kinds of assets such as images, documents, blogs, and of course, web content.
This helps in creating a more dynamic web site: you can place user-created wiki
entries, blog posts, or message board messages in context with your content.
You'll examine some of the Asset Publisher's features next.
