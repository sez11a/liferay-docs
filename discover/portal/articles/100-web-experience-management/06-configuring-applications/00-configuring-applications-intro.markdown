# Configuring Applications [](id=configuring-applications)

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
applications also share common features. These include look and feel,
exporting/importing app data, communication, sharing, permissions, scoping, and
configuration templates. You'll learn how these features work together to
facilitate information flow and provide an enhanced experience for your users.
So before you get into the nitty gritty of the applications themselves, it's
best to cover these common features first, starting with the look and feel
configuration options.
