# Assigning Template Permissions [](id=assigning-template-permissions)

Permissions for templates are similar to permissions for structures. You have 
two roles that need to access templates: the template developer who 
creates the template, and the web content writer who needs to be able to view 
the template. Templates are very powerful and could be used to run malicious 
code, so the only people who should have permission to create and edit template 
are the template developers. Content writers should only have access to view 
the template and not to write the scripts. To determine who views and interacts 
with the template,

1.  Go to the *Templates* tab.

2.  Click the Action* button (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-actions.png))
    for a template that you created and select *Permissions*.

You can grant or deny permissions based on Roles. For instance, you may create
a Role that can update the template and a second Role that can both update and
delete. @product@ makes it possible to assign permissions based on the roles and
responsibilities within your organization.
