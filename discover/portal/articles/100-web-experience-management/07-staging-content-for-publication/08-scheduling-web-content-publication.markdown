# Scheduling Web Content Publication [](id=scheduling-web-content-publication)

Liferay's WCM lets you define when your content goes live. You can determine
when the content is displayed, expired, and/or reviewed. This is an excellent
way to keep your site current and free from outdated (and perhaps incorrect)
information. The scheduler is built right into the form your users access to add
web content. Specifically, it can be found in the bottom panel listed with
several other configurable settings.

The scheduler offers several configurable options:

**Display Date:** sets (within a minute) when content will be displayed.

**Expiration Date:** sets a date to expire the content. The default is one year.

**Never Expire:** sets your content to never expire.

**Review Date:** sets a content review date.

**Never Review:** sets the content to never be reviewed.

As an example, you'll step through the process of scheduling a web content
article.

1.  Navigate to the Product Menu &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*.

2.  Create a new web content article by selecting the *Add Web Content* button
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; *Basic Web Content*.

3.  Add content for your web content article.

4.  Select the *Schedule* dropdown menu on the web content form. Configure the
    publication schedule.

5.  Click *Publish*. Your web content article is now created and will abide by
    the scheduling parameters you've set.

The scheduling feature gives you great control in managing when, and for how
long, your web content is displayed on your site. Additionally, you have the
ability to determine when your content should be reviewed for accuracy and/or
relevance. This makes it possible to manage your growing inventory of content.
