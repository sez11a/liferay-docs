# Merging Site Pages Variations [](id=using-site-pages-variations)

Another powerful feature of Staging's Page Versioning framework is the
possibility of *merging* Site Pages Variations. To merge two Site Pages
Variations, follow the instructions below.

1.  Click the Staging Bar's *Options* button
    (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) and select *Site Pages
    Variation*.

2.  Click the Site Pages Variation's *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) you want to use as the
    base for merging and select *Merge*.

3.  Select the site pages variation to merge on top of the base site pages
    variation.

    Merging works as follows:

    - New pages that don't exist in the base variation will be added.
    - If a page exists in both site pages variations, and at least one version
      of the page was marked as ready for publication, the latest version marked
      as ready will be added as a new page variation in the target page of the
      base variation. Note that older versions or page variations not marked as
      ready for publication won't be copied. Merging can be executed, however,
      as many times as needed and will create the needed page variations in the
      appropriate page of the base site pages variation.
    - Merging does not affect content nor will overwrite anything in the base
      variation; it will just add more versions, pages, and page variations as
      needed.

Great! You've merged site pages variations!
