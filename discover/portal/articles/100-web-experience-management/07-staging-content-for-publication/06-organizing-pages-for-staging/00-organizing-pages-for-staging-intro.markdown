# Organizing Pages for Staging [](id=organizing-pages-for-staging)

Let's say you're working on a product-oriented site where several major changes
are required for a page or a set of pages over a short period of time. Also, you

has been properly reviewed before it goes live. With staging, you can do this
using *Page Variations*.

In this section, you'll explore page variations and how they're useful.
