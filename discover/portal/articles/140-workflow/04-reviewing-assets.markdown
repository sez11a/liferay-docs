# Reviewing Assets

User interaction is required at each Task Node of the workflow process. How do
Users complete tasks? In the *My Workflow Tasks* application of the *My Account*
menu.

## Asset Submission to Workflow

If an Asset has a workflow activated, when a User clicks Submit for Publication,
the workflow definition determines the next step. Often, a User occupying a Role
assigned to the workflow task receives a Notification alerting them to the
presence of a workflow task that must be completed.

## Assigning the Task

Workflow Tasks can be completed only by certain Users, depending on the 
[Assignment](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-task-nodes#assignments).

All workflow tasks assigned directly to a User are listed in the My Workflow
Task application's *Assigned to Me* tab.

![Figure x: The assets assigned to a User are listed in *Assigned to Me*.](../../images/workflow-assigned-to-me.png)

If a workflow was assigned to a Role that the User occupies, tasks are shown in
the *Assigned to My Roles* tab.

![Figure x: The Assets assigned to User's Roles are listed in *Assigned to My Roles*.](../../images/workflow-assigned-to-my-roles.png)

A User wanting to complete a task assigned to a Role they occupy must first move
the task into the *Assigned to Me* tab.

1.  Click the Asset's Actions button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Assign to Me*.

2.  Add a comment in the pop-up box if necessary, and click *Done*.

Alternatively, assign the task to another User.

1.  Click the Asset's Actions button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Assign to ...*.

2.  Select the User to assign the task.

3.  Add a comment in the pop-up box if necessary, and click *Done*.

## Completing the Task

Once a task is assigned, it's ready to be completed.

There's a fast way to send an asset along in the review process:

1.  From the *Assigned to Me* tab, click the Actions button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Approve* or
    *Reject*.

    Note that the name of the options in this menu are identical to the name of the
     [Transitions](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-definition-nodes)
     in the workflow definition. Your menu might have different options than the
     pictured *Approve* and *Reject* options.

2.  Enter a comment if desired and click *Done*.

Many times you'll want a closer look at the Asset before sending it along in
the workflow:

1.  From the *Assigned to Me* tab, click the title of the Asset to review.

    The Task screen appears showing details about the Asset:

    ![Figure x: Inspect Assets before completing the Task.](../../images/workflow-task-review.png)

2.  Inspect the Asset to your liking (or even edit it if you have permission)
    and click the Actions button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)).

3.  Send it along in the workflow by clicking one of the Transition names (for
    example, *Approve* or *Reject* in the Single Approver Definition).

And, you're done. Once your workflow tasks are completed, kick back and wait for
more to come in.
