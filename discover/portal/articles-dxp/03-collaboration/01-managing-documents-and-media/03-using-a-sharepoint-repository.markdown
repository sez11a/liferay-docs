# Using a SharePoint Repository [](id=using-a-sharepoint-repository)

With the help of Liferay's Sharepoint Connector app, users can access SharePoint 
2013 and SharePoint 2016 libraries from within a @product@'s Documents and 
Media Library. The app installs a SharePoint repository type that you can select 
when adding a new *Repository* to Documents and Media. The SharePoint Connector 
integrates sites with existing SharePoint libraries, so you can access all of 
your organization's files.

The [Liferay Sharepoint Connector](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188537)
app is available to EE subscribers on Liferay's
[Marketplace](http://marketplace.liferay.com/). Refer to [Managing Apps](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/managing-apps)
for details on installing and activating apps.

Users gain these benefits by accessing the SharePoint repository through the
Liferay Sharepoint Connector: 

- Reading/writing documents and folders
- Document check-in, check-out, and undo check-out
- Downloading documents
- Moving folders and documents within the repository
- Getting revision history
- Reverting to a revision

The Liferay Sharepoint Connector uses SharePoint's API, which has some 
limitations: 

- Version history is lost when moving or renaming a file without first 
  checking it out.
- You can't change file extensions, you can only change file names.
- A file's current name propagates to all previous versions.
- The user who checks out a file is the only one who can see its working copy 
  version number.
- Queries for suffixes or intermediate wildcards convert to queries for 
  containment.  
- Comments, ratings, and using a SharePoint folder as a Documents and Media root 
  folder are unsupported. 

The Liferay Sharepoint Connector uses OAuth 2 for authorization against a 
SharePoint server, using the Azure ACS. So, **client applications 
must use @product@ through HTTPS.** 

To use a SharePoint repository inside Documents and Media, you must first create 
an application in SharePoint and authorize it to access the repository.

## Creating a SharePoint Application [](id=creating-a-sharepoint-application)

This section describes the steps required to register @product@ as an 
application in a SharePoint instance for SharePoint Online. If you're using an 
On premise SharePoint, please consult with your administrator about the details.

Follow these steps to create a SharePoint application:

1. Go to your SharePoint installation's URL 
    (`https://[your-site-name].sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx` for 
    example).

2. Provide the following information for your app:

    **Title:** The name displayed in Documents and Media.

    **Domain Name:** The application's domain name along with the port 
    (e.g. `localhost:8228`)

    **Redirect URL:** The application's URL. **The URL must use HTTPS.**

3. Click the two *Generate* buttons to generate a client ID and client 
    secret for @product@.

    An example configuration is shown below:

    **Client ID:** `1234a56b-7890-1234-5ccc-67d8ea9b0c1c`
    **Client Secret:** `1ABCDEfGh2IJKLmNoP3QrStuvwX41YzAB+CDEFg20G3=`
    **Title:** `My Application's Title`
    **App Domain:** `localhost:8228`
    **Redirect URL:** `https://localhost:8228/c/document_library/sharepoint/oauth2`

3. Next, you must grant permissions to your new SharePoint application. Go to  
    (`https://[your-site-name].sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx` for 
    example).

    In the **APP ID** field, put the Client ID of the application you just 
    created and click *Search*. One field remains: **Permission Request XML**. 
    Check Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/add-in-permissions-in-sharepoint) 
    for details on how to configure the **Permission Request XML**. Below is an 
    example configuration that grants the application write and search 
    permissions over the SharePoint instance:

        <AppPermissionRequests>
            <AppPermissionRequest
                scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web/list"
                Right="Write" 
            />
            <AppPermissionRequest
                scope="http://sharepoint/search"
                Right="QueryAsUserIgnoreAppPrincipal" 
            />
        </AppPermissionRequests>

    +$$$

    **Note:** @product@ requires write and search permissions for normal 
    operation. Other permissions are ignored.

    $$$
    
4. Once you've provided the permissions XML, click the *Create* button to 
    complete the assignment.

5. Next, go to *Settings* &rarr; *Site App Permissions* in your SharePoint 
    installation (or go to  
    `https://[your-site-name].sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appprincipals.aspx?Scope=Web`). 
    A list of all registered applications is displayed. Note your application's 
    *app identifier* (`i:0i.t|ms.sp.ext|6123d38d-2998-4972-9aaa-71a4da9f3a5a@b9c24ab3-ad34-4943-ab57-729d8c329053` 
    for example). You'll use this to create a repository configuration next.

## Creating a New SharePoint Repository Configuration [](id=creating-a-new-sharepoint-repo-configuration)

To connect to a remote SharePoint server you must create a repository 
configuration. First, you must enable HTTPS support in your app server. For 
instance, the required steps for Tomcat can be found in their documentation 
[here](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html).

Once you've enabled support in your app server for HTTPS, follow these steps to 
create a new SharePoint repository configuration:

1. Open the Control Panel and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* 
    &rarr; *Collaboration* &rarr; *Sharepoint OAuth2*
    
    ![Figure 1: Use the *Sharepoint OAuth2* system setting to create a new SharePoint repository configuration.](../../../images-dxp/sharepoint-system-setting.png)

2. Click the *Add* icon (![Add](../../../images-dxp/icon-portlet-add-control.png)) 
    to create a new configuration.

3. In the new Repository form specify values for the following fields 
    (your SharePoint administrator can provide you with this information):

    **Name:** The configuration's name.

    **Authorization grant endpoint:** The URL used to request OAuth2 
    authorization grants. If you're using SharePoint Online, this should look 
    similar to this URL: 
    `https://[your-site-name]/sharepoint.com/_layouts/oauthauthorize.aspx`.
    
    **Authorization token endpoint:** The ACS URL. If you're using SharePoint 
    Online with Azure ACS, the URL has the following pattern: 
    `https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/[App ID]/tokens/OAuth/2`.

    **Client ID:** The client ID.

    **Client Secret:** The client secret.

    **Scope:** The permission set required for your tokens. Valid scopes are 
    configured during your app's SharePoint registration.

    **Tenant ID:** The Tenant ID. If you're using SharePoint Online, you can use 
    the same App ID you embedded in the `Authorization token endpoint`.

    **Site domain:** The site domain registered for your application.

    **Resource:** This value depends on the ACS service you use. If you're using 
    SharePoint Online with Azure ACS, the value is similar to this: 
    `00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000/[your-site-name].sharepoint.com@[tenant ID]`.
    
    ![Figure 2: The Repostiory Configuration form is where you specify access to the SharePoint Library you want to use.](../../../images-dxp/sharepoint-new-repo-configuration.png)
    
4. Click *Save*.

Now that your SharePoint repository is configured, you can mount it into 
@product@'s Documents and Media Library. 

## Adding SharePoint as a @product@ Documents and Media Repository [](id=add-sharepoint-as-a-liferay-documents-and-media-repository) 

Follow these steps to add a SharePoint Library repository type to Documents and 
Media in @product@:

1. Add the Documents and Media application to a page, if you haven't 
    already.

2. From the home location in the Documents and Media application, click the
    *Add* icon (![Add](../../../images-dxp/icon-portlet-add-control.png)) and 
    select *Repository*. The  New Repository screen appears. 

3. Select the repository type for the SharePoint OAuth2 configuration you 
    created. For example, if your configuration is named `Foo`, the repository 
    type is listed as `SharePoint (Foo)`.

4. Specify values for the following fields:

    **Site Absolute URL**: Resolves relative URLs. For SharePoint 
    Online the value is similar to this: `https://[your-site-name].sharepoint.com`.

    **Library Path**: A relative path from the `Site Absolute URL` that points 
    to the SharePoint Document Library you want to mount in Documents and Media 
    (for example, `Shared Documents`).
    
    ![Figure 3: The Repostiory Configuration form is where you specify access to the SharePoint Library you want to use.](../../../images-dxp/sharepoint-repo-configuration-form.png)

5. After you've finished entering any additional options, click *Save*.

Your SharePoint repository is now listed in the Documents and Media Library.

+$$$

**Note:** The first time you access a mounted SharePoint repository, it 
redirects you to your SharePoint instance, where you must log in and grant 
permissions to @product@ to access the repository.

$$$

Now that you've added a SharePoint Repository to Documents and Media, you can
access and modify SharePoint Library files from within @product@'s Documents and
Media Library!
