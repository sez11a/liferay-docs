# Creating Data Record Collections with HTTP

[TOC levels=1-4]

Data Record Collections collect Data Records in the Data Engine. A Data
Definition defines the fields present in the Data Record, while the Data Record
Collection forms a boundary, collecting only records associated with its Primary
Key. The Data Record Collection has a unique ID, a name, and a description. Each
individual Data Record Collection is associated with a single Data Definition's
Primary Key. 

These example calls use cURL, a cross-platform tool for making HTTP calls. Feel
free to use any REST client you know. 

## Adding, Retrieving, and Deleting Data Record Collections

At a bare minimum, you need the Data Definition's ID. If you copied it from the
response message after you added the Data Definition, you're all set. If you
need to look it up, send a GET request for the Site's data definitions. In this
case you'll need the Site ID, which can be retrieved from Site Administration
&rarr; Configuration &rarr; Settings.

In this example GET call, the Site ID is 20123:

```sh
curl -i -X GET   http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/sites/20123/data-definitions   -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0'   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

The response body contains the Data Definition's data, including the `id`. Copy
it.

Now use it to add a Data Record Collection. Here the data definition ID is
`86524`:

```sh
curl -i -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/data-definitions/86524/data-record-collections \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "description": {
        	"en_US": "description"
    },
    "name": {
         	"en_US": "All Orders"
    }
}'
```

In addition to sending POST calls to add data record collections, you can
retrieve all the Site's data record collections.

### Retrieving a Site's Data Record Collections

Pass the Site ID in to the GET request:

```sh
curl -i -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/sites/20123/data-record-collections \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

### Deleting a Site's Data Record Collections


Delete data record collections with a DELETE request. You'll need the data
record collection ID:

```sh
curl -i -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/data-record-collections/85637 \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
