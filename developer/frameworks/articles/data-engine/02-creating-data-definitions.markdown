# Creating Data Definitions with REST Calls

[TOC levels=1-4]

These example calls use cURL, a cross-platform tool for making HTTP calls. Feel
free to use any REST client you know.

### Adding Data Definitions

Get the `siteId` from the Site Menu &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Site Settings.

In this example, it's 20123.

```sh
curl -i -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/sites/20123/data-definitions \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "availableLanguageIds": ["en_US"],
    "dataDefinitionFields": [
        {
            "fieldType": "text",
            "name": "product"
        }
    ],
    "defaultLangugageId": "en_US",
    "description": {
            "en_US": "Description"
    },
    "name": {
            "en_US": "Order"
    }
}'
```

Here you specify the endpoint for the data definitions API, passing in the
`siteId`. Then you create a request body that includes

`availableLanguageIds`
: Enter the IDs of the available languages.

`dataDefinitionFields`
: The example above is simple, with just a `fieldType` and a `name` element for
one field. Here's the complete list of elements that each field can have:

| Property | Description |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| `customProperties` | these depend on the field type (listed below) |
| `defaultValue` | set a default value for a field |
| `fieldType` | the field type |
| `id` | set by the system |
| `indexable` | set to `true` (default)  or `false` to control whether the fields are indexed in the search engine |
| `label` | set a human readable label for each of the custom properties the fields has |
| `localizable` | can be set to `true` (default) or `false` to control whether the locale of the User is appended when he or she adds a data record |
| `name` | a required element that names the field (defaults to `string`) |
| `nestedDataDefinitionFields` | set of data definition fields |
| `repeatable` | set to `true` or `false` to control whether the field accepts multiple values per data record |
| `tip` | provide help text for the field's properties |
| `dataDefinitionKey` | set by the system |
| `dataDefinitionRules` | set validation rules for the data definition |
| `dateCreated` and `dateModified` | these are set by the system, so it's not necessary to do anything here |
| `defaultLangugageId` | the ID of the default language |
| `description` | use this optional element to describe the data definition |
| `id` | set by the system |
| `name` | name the data definition |
| `siteId` | the ID of the site the data definition is scoped to |
| `storageType` | the default is `string`, which is how the JSON is stored in the database |
| `userId` | the ID of the User making the service call |

Each field has its own custom properties. Here is the complete list of fields
and properties:

`showAsSwitcher`
: set to `true` or `false` to control whether the checkbox is displayed as a
switcher.

`inline`
: set to `true` or `false` to control whether the options are going to be shown
inline or not.

`options`

`tooltip`

For a complete view of the JSON structure of a data definitions, see the
[`data-engine-rest-impl/rest-openapi.yaml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.2.x/modules/apps/data-engine/data-engine-rest-impl/rest-openapi.yaml)
file. For a more robust User Experience, copy the file contents into the [Swagger
Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and get auto-generated Open API docs. 

One your POST call is processed, a `DataDefinition` is returned in the body. You
will need its `id` to create data record collections for the definition's
records.

{
  "dataDefinitionFields" : [ {
    "fieldType" : "text",
    "indexable" : true,
    "localizable" : false,
    "name" : "product",
    "repeatable" : false
  } ],
  "dateCreated" : "2019-05-23T20:18:16Z",
  "dateModified" : "2019-05-23T20:18:16Z",
  "id" : 39108,
  "siteId" : 20123,
  "userId" : 20129
}
```

Here you can see that some information was added by the data engine itself:

`id` is a number generated by the system.

`indexable` is set to `true` by default, so the field is indexed in the search
engine.

`localizable` is set to `false` by default.

`repeatable` is set to `false` by default, so submitting the same field multiple
times for the same data record is not allowed.

`dateCreated` and `dateModified`: the data engine updates this metadata when the
data definition is first created and when it's updated, respectively.

`userId` is set to the numeric ID of the User that created the definition.

Before we move on, it's important to understand the relationship between the
data definition and the information you'll collect from Users, as a data record.
A data record must conform to the fields defined in this data definition
creation step. Therefore, when you add a data record in a later step
your request must use a `dataRecordValues` structure like this:

```json
    "dataRecordValues": {

        "product": "Bicycle"
    }
```

### Retrieving Data Definitions

In addition to adding data definitions, you can make GET calls to the service.
Retrieve all the data definitions in a Site by passing in the Site ID (`20123`
here):

```sh
curl -i -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/sites/20123/data-definitions \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

### Deleting Data Definitions

Data definitions can also be deleted with a DELETE request. You'll need the data
definition ID:

```sh
curl -i -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8080/o/data-engine/v1.0/data-definitions/39108 \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

Deleting a data definition also deletes all associated Data Record Collections,
Data Records, and Data Layouts.
