# Data Engine

[TOC levels=1-4]

Past versions of @product@ included a robust framework for creating form and
list-based applications, either programmatically or from the Dynamic Data Lists
Application. While Dynamic Data Lists continue to exist, the new Data Engine
framework was written. It's much easier to use, and it supports the new
[headless approach to writing APIs](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/headless-rest-apis). 
In @product-ver@, only the back-end APIs are available for developers. Future
releases will add a front-end tool on top of the new Data Engine API to allow
non-developers to create applications. For now, developers can use the API to 

1.  Create front-end applications running outside @product@, making service
    calls from a REST client to the Data Engine APIs.

2.  Create applications inside @product@ that call the Data Engine's local APIs
    APIs for their persistence code.

To start discovering the Data Engine API and the other headless REST APIs of
@product@, read
[here](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/get-started-discover-the-api). 

The Data Engine framework has four fundamental entities. You'll be familiar with
the roles of each Data Engine entity if you used the Dynamic Data List framework
in the past.

1.  Data Definitions
2.  Data Record Collections
3.  Data Records
4.  Data Layouts

For detailed information on the Data Engine API, visit the [SwaggerHub profile](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/liferayinc/data-engine/1.0).

##  Data Definitions

Data Definitions (`DataDefinition`s) hold the form's field types (e.g., text,
boolean, date, radio buttons, selector menus, etc.) and those fields' labels and
settings. Data definitions effectively serve as data models for a Data
Collection. For example, you could create a data definition with two text
fields: one for users' names and one for their comments. 

It's important to understand that deleting a data definition simultaneously
deletes all the entities associated with it (Data Record Collections, Data
Records, and Data Layouts).

## Data Record Collections

Data Record Collections (`DataRecordCollection`s) collect Data Records.
They're used to associate a displayed form with the data records it holds and
its backing data definition.

## Data Records

Data Records are the individual form entries for a given Data Record
Collection.

## Data Layouts

There's another important piece to the Data Engine framework: data display.

Data Layouts display the form fields (defined in the data definition) in rows
and columns.

The articles in this section show example calls to the Data Engine REST API for
each entity. For a complete reference guide to the API, visit the
