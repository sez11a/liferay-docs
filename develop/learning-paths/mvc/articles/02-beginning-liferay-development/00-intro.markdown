# Beginning Liferay Development

If you're just getting started with Liferay development, Liferay's learning
paths are for you. We start at the beginning: installing a Liferay development
environment. Though you can use anything from a text editor and the command
line to any Java IDE that's out there, Liferay provides two development tools
that make it easier to write code on Liferay's platform. 

Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio are nearly identical development
environments designed for creating Liferay projects. Both are based on Eclipse,
a widely used open source IDE. 

If you're a Liferay Enterprise Edition subscriber or interested in Liferay's
premier development environment, begin with 
[Developing Applications with Liferay Developer Studio (not yet written)](/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/7-0/).

If you want to use Liferay's free development environment or want to leverage
it on top of an existing Eclipse installation, skip over to 
[Developing Applications with Liferay IDE](/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-apps-with-liferay-ide). 

Note: To follow Liferay's learning paths, you must have the Java 7 JDK and a
Liferay Portal 7.0 instance installed. You must also have
[Blade Tools](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-blade-tools)
installed.
