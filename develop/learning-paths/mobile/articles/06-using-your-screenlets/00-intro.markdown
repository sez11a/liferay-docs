# Using the Get Guestbooks and Get Entries Screenlets [](id=using-the-get-guestbooks-and-get-entries-screenlets)

Now that you have the Get Guestbooks and Get Entries Screenlets, you're ready to 
put them to work. As you'll see, using these Screenlets isn't much more 
difficult than using Login Screenlet. This an advantage of using Screenlets: it 
typically takes only a few minutes to get them up and running. They also 
integrate seamlessly with the rest of your app's UI. 

Since you're using these Screenlets in the same app you developed earlier in 
this Learning Path with the Guestbook Mobile SDK, you need to do some 
refactoring first. The next article walks you through this. If you get confused 
or stuck at any point in this section of the Learning Path, refer to the 
finished app's code 
[here in GitHub](https://github.com/ngaskill/liferay-docs/tree/LRDOCS-1816-android-lp/develop/learning-paths/mobile/code/06-using-your-screenlets/LiferayGuestbook).
