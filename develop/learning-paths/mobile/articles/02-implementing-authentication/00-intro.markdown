# Implementing Authentication [](id=implementing-authentication)

Now that your project is ready for Liferay Screens, you're ready to implement 
portal authentication in your app. Your app's users need to be able to log in to 
the portal with their credentials. The other features you'll develop in your app 
depend on successful portal authentication. If developing the UI and server 
calls required for authentication sounds complex, then you're in luck; Liferay 
has already developed this for you. All you need to do is use Login Screenlet in 
your app's main activity. The next article shows you how to do this.
