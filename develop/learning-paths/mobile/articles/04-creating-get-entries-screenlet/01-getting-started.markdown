# Getting Started with Get Entries Screenlet [](id=getting-started-with-get-entries-screenlet)

Like Get Guestbooks Screenlet, you'll create Get Entries Screenlet in a new 
package inside your app's project. You'll do this because you don't need to 
redistribute the Screenlet. Get started by creating the package 
`com.liferay.docs.getentriesscreenlet`. Once you have this package, you're ready 
to start writing the Screenlet. 

## Creating the Model Class for Entries [](id=creating-the-model-class-for-entries)

As with Get Guestbooks Screenlet, Get Entries Screenlet must use the same 
Guestbook Mobile SDK you built earlier to call the Guestbook portlet. Thus, the 
Screenlet needs a model class that can transform the JSON containing the entries 
into proper entry model objects. To do this, you can reuse the existing 
`EntryModel` class. In Android Studio's project view, copy `EntryModel` and 
paste it in the `getentriesscreenlet` package. In the *Copy Class* dialogue that 
appears, accept the defaults and click *OK*. If you need a review of how 
`EntryModel` works, see 
[this Learning Path article](/develop/learning-paths/mobile/-/knowledge_base/6-2/retrieving-guestbook-entries#creating-the-model-class-for-entries).

Next, you need to create the Screenlet's UI.
