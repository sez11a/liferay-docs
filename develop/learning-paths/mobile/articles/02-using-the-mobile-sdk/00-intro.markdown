# Using the Mobile SDK [](id=using-the-mobile-sdk)

If you followed along with the previous series of articles in this Learning 
Path, you should have a Liferay installation with a Guestbook portlet that 
contains a couple of guestbooks and accompanying entries. You should also have 
an Android app that contains Liferay Screens, the Guestbook Mobile SDK you 
built, and an empty activity. Now it's time to put it all to work! When you're 
finished, you'll have an Android app capable of authenticating portal users and 
displaying the Guestbook portlet's contents. If you get confused or stuck, see 
[the finished app in GitHub](https://github.com/ngaskill/liferay-docs/tree/LRDOCS-1816-android-lp/develop/learning-paths/mobile/code/03-retrieving-data-mobile-sdk/LiferayGuestbook). 
<!-- Change link to finished app once it's merged into 6.2.x -->

You'll develop this app by following these steps:

1. Understanding the App's Design.

2. Use Login Screenlet for Authentication.

3. Retrieve and Display Guestbooks.

4. Retrieve and Display Entries.

This Learning Path's next article takes you through the first step by explaining 
the app's design.
