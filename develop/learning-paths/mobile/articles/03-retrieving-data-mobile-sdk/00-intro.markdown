# Retrieving and Displaying Portlet Data with the Mobile SDK [](id=retrieving-and-displaying-portlet-data-with-the-mobile-sdk)

When developing Android apps with the Liferay Mobile SDK, retrieving and 
displaying portlet data is often the first piece of functionality to add. If you 
followed along with the previous series of articles in this Learning Path, you 
should have a Liferay installation with a Guestbook portlet that contains a 
couple of guestbooks and accompanying entries. You should also have an Android 
app with a Mobile SDK installed that can call this portlet's remote services. 
Now it's time to put it all to work! When you're finished, you'll have an
Android app capable of displaying the Guestbook portlet's contents. If you get
tired or scared, come back here and look at the screenshot below for motivation:
it's what you'll have when you're done here. If you get confused or stuck, see 
[the finished app in GitHub](https://github.com/ngaskill/liferay-docs/tree/LRDOCS-1816-android-lp/develop/learning-paths/mobile/code/03-retrieving-data-mobile-sdk/LiferayGuestbook). 
Now venture forth and fear no remote service!
