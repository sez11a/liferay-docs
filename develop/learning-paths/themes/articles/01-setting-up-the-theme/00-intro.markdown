# Setting up the Theme

In this portion of the learning path you'll set up the foundation for the Lunar
Resort theme. You'll learn the proper workflow and directory structure needed to
create a Freemarker theme. Finally, you'll modify the default
`portal/_normal.ftl` and `navigation.ftl` templates to match the Lunar Resort 
mockup.

A theme mockup serves as a guide for what the finished theme will look like. 
Take a look at the mockup for the Lunar Resort below:
