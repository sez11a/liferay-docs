# Previewing Your Theme

To determine what changes need to be made, you can use Liferay's preview window 
to see how the theme responds with the existing CSS styles. Locate the dockbar 
icons on the left side of the screen. Underneath the plus icon, you'll see a 
screen icon: this is the *Preview button*.

1. Click the *Preview button* to bring up the *Preview window*.

Due to the way the Preview window is rendered, make sure you have the page 
scrolled all the way to the top before clicking the Preview button. Failing to 
do so may result in the Preview window being out of view.

Now inside of the Preview menu you can see four default render options available 
to you, as well as a Custom ratio size option. By default you'll see your site 
in the *Smartphone* aspect ratio. A good rule of thumb is to work organically, 
starting with the desktop view you're used to and previewing your theme on 
smaller and smaller aspect ratios. By the end of this section you'll understand
why this is true. For the moment, just keep it in mind and get started. 

1. Select the *Tablet* aspect ratio.

    Each device displays the site in portrait view by default. If you click on 
    the *Tablet* aspect ratio a second time, you'll see that your site is now 
    rendered in landscape view. Clicking the current aspect ratio for the third 
    time will return your view back to portrait. 

2. Scroll through the theme in the Preview window and you'll see the elements 
   that need modified. 

    First of all, the carousel is outside the borders of the page, so it should 
    be removed in tablet view. Second, While the navigation is functional, it's 
    not very tablet friendly, so it will need updated. Finally, while the logo 
    looks ok, it could be scaled down some.

    As a best practice, you should also see how the theme responds in landscape 
    view. 

3. Switch to landscape view to verify that the same elements need modified 
   for the tablet.

    Now that the theme has been tested on the tablet, you can see how it 
    responds to a phone next.

4. Select the *Smartphone* aspect ratio to view it.

5. Scroll through the site in the Preview window to see how it responds to a 
   phone.

Now in the *Smartphone* aspect ratio, you can see that the same areas that gave 
some concern on a tablet are more obvious in this aspect ratio: The logo is too 
large for this view and needs to be scaled down; the navigation is even more 
closed in then before; the carousel is even further beyond the borders of the 
page and definitely needs to be removed in this view.

Everything else seems to be responding well. Switching to landscape view 
confirms the same.

Now that you have identifed which elements need modified for responsiveness, you
can move on to the next section.
