# Making configurable theme settings

Theme settings allow you to give Administrators control over the elements of 
the page, without having to touch any of the code directly.

Theme settings can then be modified on either a site-wide or a page by page 
basis. With a few simple clicks of the mouse, an Admin can remove and add theme 
elements that you've configured to do so.

Now that you know the level of control that theme settings can provide, you can 
learn how to configure them next.

First, you'll need to identify the theme elements you want to make configurable.
In the case of the Lunar Resort, the *Breadcrumbs*, Portlet borders, and *Page
Title* elements are going to be configurable.

Now that you know which elements you want to give the Administrator control
over, you can get started.
