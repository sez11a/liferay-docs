# Styling Your Theme with CSS

In the previous sections of the Learning Path you built the framework for the
theme and imported the content for the Lunar Resort. The end result may have 
seemed a little underwhelming. All your work left you with what appeared to be 
a broken theme. Rest assured, your hard work was not for nothing. In this 
section of the Learning Path you'll create the CSS that will style the theme 
elements you put in place in the previous sections.

Go ahead and get started!
