# Making Your Application Configurable

Here, you'll learn how to make Liferay applications configurable. It starts with
basic configuration and then covers some advanced use cases. The methods
described here are not mandatory. You can make your applications configurable
using any other mechanism that you know. We have found, however, that the method
described here provides the largest benefit with the smallest amount of effort.

The steps described in this tutorial must be applied to an existing Liferay
application. If you need to create such and application, follow the steps in the
[Creating a Portlet Application]() and [Using JSPs in a Portlet Application]()
tutorials.

## Fundamentals 

While you don't need to know much to make your applications configurable,
understanding a few concepts helps you achieve a higher degree of
configurability with little effort.

The first important concept is that the method described here uses *typed*
configuration. That means that the application configuration isn't just a list
of key-value pairs. The values can be types, like `Integer`, a list of
`Strings`, a URL, etc. Using a typed configuration can prevent many programmatic
errors. Related to this, the configuration options should be programmatically
explicit, so that developers can use autocomplete in modern IDEs to find out all
of the configuration options of a given application or one of its components.

A second concept that you should know about is modularity. With Liferay 7,
applications are modular and are built as a collection of lightweight
components. A *component* is just a class that has the `@Component` annotation,
often along with a set of properties to provide metadata. The configuration
mechanisms described here leverage the concept of components.

A third important concept is the ability to have different configurations for
the same application at different scopes. Not all applications need this, but if
you do, the APIs described below handle most of the burden for you. It's still
good, however, for you to understand the term *configuration scope*. Here are
the most common configuration scopes that Liferay applications can have:

1. **System:** configuration that is unique for the complete Liferay
   installation. 
2. **Portal Instance:** configuration that can vary per Liferay portal instance.
3. **Site:** configuration that can vary per Liferay site.
4. **Portlet Instance:** applicable for applications that are placed on a page
   (i.e., portlets). Each placement (instance) of the application on the page
   can have a different configuration.

That's it for now. You are ready to get started with some code. If you already
have a portlet or service that was configurable using the traditional mechanisms
of Liferay 6.2 and before, you might also want to read
[How to change your portlets and services to use the new Configuration API](https://docs.google.com/a/liferay.com/document/d/1o6U0fqsUv9WSJTLQmSytMMcW2exUwWclZPQ5A3vUKwc/edit#)[](https://docs.google.com/a/liferay.com/document/d/1o6U0fqsUv9WSJTLQmSytMMcW2exUwWclZPQ5A3vUKwc/edit#). 

## Defining a Configuration 

Now you'll see the minimum amount of code you need to write to make your
application configurable the Liferay 7 way. The System scope is covered first.

Your first step is to create a Java interface to represent the configuration and
its default values. The reason for using a Java interface is that it allows for
an advanced type system for each of the configuration options. Here is an
example of such an interface:

    package com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet.configuration;

    import aQute.bnd.annotation.metatype.Meta;

    @Meta.OCD(id = "com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet.configuration.ExampleConfiguration")
    public interface ExampleConfiguration {

        @Meta.AD(
            deflt = "es",
            required = false
        )
        public String defaultLanguage();

        @Meta.AD(
            deflt = "en|es|pt",
            required = false
        )
        public String[] validLanguages();

    }

As you can see, you are using two Java annotations to provide some metadata about
the configuration. Here is what they do:

1. **Meta.OCD:** (*OCD* stands for *object class declaration*.) Registers this
   class as a configuration with a specific id. You can choose any string you
   want, but make sure it's unique. A common pattern is to use the fully
   qualified class name. 
2. **Meta.AD:** (*AD* stands for *attribute definition*.) Specifies the default
   value of a configuration field as well as whether it's required or not. Note
   that if you set a field as required and don't specify a default value, the
   system administrator must specify a value for your application to work
   properly.

For more information about the `Meta.OCD` and `Meta.AD` annotations, please see
this document:
[http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/MetaType](http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/MetaType). There,
you can find lists of the supported parameters for these annotations. The
`deflt` parameter lets you specify a default value for a configuration setting.
The `required` parameter lets you specify whether or not a configuration setting
is required. A required configuration setting must be set in order for the
application to work properly.

With this information, the system already knows a lot about your application's
configuration options. In fact it knows enough to generate a user interface
automatically. Cool, isn't it?

## Instantiating a Configuration

At this point you might be wondering, while this is pretty cool, how do I read
the configuration from my application code? It's actually quite easy. Here's an
example:

    package com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet;

    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Map;

    import javax.portlet.Portlet;
    import javax.portlet.PortletException;
    import javax.portlet.RenderRequest;
    import javax.portlet.RenderResponse;

    import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Activate;
    import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;
    import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Modified;

    import com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet.configuration.ExampleConfiguration;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCPortlet;

    import aQute.bnd.annotation.metatype.Configurable;

    @Component(
        configurationPid = "com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet.configuration.ExampleConfiguration",
        immediate = true,
        property = {
            "com.liferay.portlet.display-category=category.sample",
            "com.liferay.portlet.instanceable=true",
            "javax.portlet.display-name=Example Config Portlet",
            "javax.portlet.init-param.config-template=/configuration.jsp",
            "javax.portlet.init-param.template-path=/",
            "javax.portlet.init-param.view-template=/view.jsp",
            "javax.portlet.security-role-ref=power-user,user"
        },
        service = Portlet.class
    )
    public class ExampleConfigurationPortlet extends MVCPortlet {
        
        @Activate
        @Modified
        protected void activate(Map<String, Object> properties) {
            _configuration = Configurable.createConfigurable(
                ExampleConfiguration.class, properties);
        }
        
        @Override
        public void doView(RenderRequest request, RenderResponse response)
                throws PortletException, IOException {

            request.setAttribute(
                ExampleConfiguration.class.getName(), _configuration);
                    
            super.doView(request, response);
        }
        
        private volatile ExampleConfiguration _configuration;

    }

Here are the most relevant aspects of this example one by one:

1. This class is a component, specified with the `@Component` annotation. In the
   example, the class happens be a portlet class that extends Liferay's
   `MVCPortlet` class. This is not required. You can decorate any class in your
   application with the `@Component` annotation and use the `configurationPid`
   property to point to your configuration interface.
2. The example's `configurationPid` points to the configuration with ID
   `com.liferay.docs.exampleconfigportlet.configuration.ExampleConfiguration`.
   The `activate` method is invoked when the application starts (due to the
   `@Activate` annotation) and whenever the configuration is modified (due to
   the `@Modified` annotation). The `activate` method initializes the
   `ExampleConfiguration` instance of the class.
3. The `activate` method uses the method `Configurable.createConfigurable()` to
   convert a map of properties with the configuration to our typed class, which
   is easier to handle. 
4. The configuration is stored in a `volatile` field. Don't forget to declare it
   `volatile` or you'll run into weird problems. 

The `doView` method is not required to read the configuration. It's there
because the class in the example is a portlet class. The line
`request.setAttribute(ExampleConfiguration.class.getName(), _configuration);`
adds the configuration object to the request as an attribute. This allows the
portlet's JSPs to access the configuration from the request and read values from
the configuration.

That's it. With very few lines of code, you have a configurable application that
dynamically changes its configuration, has an auto-generated UI, and uses a
simple API to access the configuration.

## Supporting Different Configurations Per Scope 

When an application is deployed to Liferay, it's common to need different
configurations depending on the scope. That means having different
configurations for a given service per portal instance or site. It's also very
common to need different configurations for each portlet instance. Liferay 7
provides an easy way to achieve this with little effort through a new framework
called the Settings API.

In order to use the Settings API you need to take the following steps.

1. Declare the configuration interface by creating a
   `ConfigurationBeanDeclaration` class:

        @Component
        public class RSSPortletInstanceConfigurationBeanDeclaration
          implements ConfigurationBeanDeclaration {

          @Override
          public Class getConfigurationBeanClass() {
             return RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration.class;
          }

        }

2. Obtain the configuration using the following code: 

        RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration rssPortletInstanceConfiguration =
          _settingsFactory.getSettings(
             RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration.class,
             new PortletInstanceSettingsLocator(
                themeDisplay.getLayout(), portletDisplay.getId()));

        RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration rssPortletInstanceConfiguration =
          _settingsFactory.getPortletInstanceSettings(
             RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration.class,
             themeDisplay.getLayout(), portletDisplay.getId()));

3. In order to get the `SettingsFactory`, your class must have a method: 

        @Reference
        protected void setSettingsFactory(SettingsFactory settingsFactory) {
          _settingsFactory = settingsFactory;
        }

### Accessing the Portlet Instance Settings through the PortletDisplay 

Often it's necessary to access a portlet's settings from its JSPs or from Java
classes that are not OSGi components. To make it easier to read the settings in
these cases, a new method has been added to `PortletDisplay` (available as a
request object). Here is an example of how to use it:

    RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration rssPortletInstanceConfiguration =
        portletDisplay.getPortletInstanceConfiguration(

            RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration.class);

As you can see, it knows how to find the values and returns a typed bean
containing them just by passing the configuration class.

### Reusing the same configuration class for different purposes 

The settings service also allows reusing a single class for different
configuration needs. In order to support this, you must create a class that
maps the different scenarios to the class that will be used. Here is an example:

    @Component
    public class RSSPortletInstanceSettingsIdMapping implements SettingsIdMapping {

      @Override
      public Class<?> getConfigurationBeanClass() {
         return RSSPortletInstanceConfiguration.class;
      }

      @Override
      public String getSettingsId() {
         return RSSPortletKeys.RSS;
      }

    }
