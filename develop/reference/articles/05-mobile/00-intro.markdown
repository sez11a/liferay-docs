# Screenlets in Liferay Screens

Liferay Screens includes several Screenlets that you can use in your mobile 
apps. Screenlets are ready-to-use components that contain a complete UI and the 
code necessary to call @product@'s remote services for tasks like logging in, 
displaying portal content, submitting forms, and much more. 

This section contains each Screenlet's reference documentation in separate 
sections for Android and iOS. Each document in these sections lists a 
Screenlet's features, compatibility, available Views, attributes, listener 
methods, and more:
