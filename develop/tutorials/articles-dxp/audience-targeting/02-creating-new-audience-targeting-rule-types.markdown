# Creating New Audience Targeting Rule Types [](id=creating-new-audience-targeting-rule-types)

In the Audience Targeting application, a User Segment is defined as a group of
users that match a set of rules. Out of the box, Liferay provides several types
of rules that are based on characteristics such as age range, gender, location,
and so on. Visit the
[Liferay Audience Targeting Rules](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-audience-targeting-rules)
article for information on each rule type and their configuration options. To
extend the set of available rule types, you can create a class that implements
the `Rule` interface and deploy the class in your own OSGi plugin.

This tutorial shows you how to create a custom rule type and deploy it in an
OSGi plugin.

## Creating a Custom Rule Type [](id=creating-a-custom-rule-type)

Adding a new type of rule to the Audience Targeting application is easy. There
are three components you can specify for your rule:

- *Rule Behavior*
- *UI for Configuration (optional)*
- *Language Keys (optional)*

Before you can define your rule's components, you must create a module and
ensure it has the necessary Content Targeting dependencies.

1. Create a module for deploying a rule using your favorite third party tool. A
   Blade CLI
   [contenttargetingrule](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/content-targeting-rule-template)
   template is available to help you get started quickly by setting all the
   default configuration for you, and it contains boilerplate code so you can
   skip the file creation steps and get started right away.

2. Make sure your module specifies the dependencies necessary for an Audience
   Targeting rule. For example, you should specify the Content Targeting API and
   necessary Liferay packages. For example, examine the example `build.gradle`
   file used from a Gradle based rule:

        dependencies {
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.content-targeting", name: "com.liferay.content.targeting.analytics.api", version: "3.0.0"
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.content-targeting", name: "com.liferay.content.targeting.anonymous.users.api", version: "2.0.2"
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.content-targeting", name: "com.liferay.content.targeting.api", version: "4.0.0"
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.portal.kernel", version: "2.3.0"
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.util.taglib", version: "2.0.0"
            compileOnly group: "javax.portlet", name: "portlet-api", version: "2.0"
            compileOnly group: "javax.servlet", name: "javax.servlet-api", version: "3.0.1"
            compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.service.component.annotations", version: "1.3.0"
        }

Once you've created your module and specified its dependencies, you'll need to
define your rule's behavior. The behavior of your rule is controlled from a Java
class file that you create.

1. Create a unique package name in the module's `src` directory, and create a
   new Java class in that package. To follow naming conventions, your class name
   should begin with the rule name you're creating, and end with *Rule* (e.g.,
   `WeatherRule.java`). Your Java class should implement the `Rule` interface.

2. Directly above the class's declaration, insert the following code:

        @Component(immediate = true, service = Rule.class)

    This annotation declares the implementation class of the Component, and
    specifies to immediately start the module once deployed to @product@.

Before diving deeper into your `-Rule` class, it's important to understand what
is available for you to extend from this class. It is required to implement the
`Rule` interface, but there are `Rule` extension classes you can extend from in
your custom rule, which provide helpful utilities. For example, you can extend
the `BaseJSPRule` class for support when generating your rule's UI using JSPs.

Since Liferay 7.0, JSP is the preferred technology for Audience Targeting
extension views. FreeMarker views, however, are still supported through their
respective base classes (e.g., `BaseFreemarkerRule`). If you're interested in
using a technology besides JSP or FreeMarker to implement your UI, you can add a
method `getFormHTML` to your `-Rule` class.

The `getFormHTML` is used to retrieve the HTML created by the technology you
choose, and to return it as a string that is viewable from your rule's form.
If you plan, therefore, on using an alternative to JSP or FreeMarker, you
must override this method by creating and modifying it in your `-Rule` class.
This tutorial demonstrates implementing the UI using JSP, and assumes the `Rule`
interface is implemented by extending the `BaseJSPRule` class.

Of course, you still need to make some additional changes to define how your
rule works. Here are some of the methods that you can implement to modify your
rule behavior:

<!-- The below method descriptions are the Javadoc copied from the `Rule`
interface. Since the source code is not accessible and the Javadoc for Audience
Targeting is not currently published, I've provided some methods and
descriptions until the Javadoc is available publicly. -Cody -->

- `activate`: Does processing when the rule is installed.
- `deActivate`: Does processing when the rule is uninstalled.
- `deleteData`: Removes any additional data added by this rule when the rule
  instance is removed.
- `evaluate(HttpServletRequest, RuleInstance, AnonymousUser)`: Returns `true` if
  the user complies with the rule instance in real time. The evaluation is
  completed correctly after the user makes a request.
- `evaluate(Map, RuleInstance, AnonymousUser)`: Returns `true` if the user
  complies with the rule instance in an offline mode. The evaluation is
  completed without having a user request. This will only be called if the rule
  supports offline evaluation. A context map can be optionally passed with some
  context variables.
- `exportData`: Exports any additional data added by this rule when the rule
  instance is exported.
- `getCacheTime`: Returns the time in milliseconds that the evaluation of this
  rule can be cached. For example, an Age rule can be cached at least 1 day and
  a Geolocation rule could be cached 5 minutes. This value can be configurable
  by adding a custom configuration to your component. A value of `0` means that
  the evaluation can not be cached.
- `getDescription`: Returns the rule localized description.
- `getFormHTML`: Returns the HTML code containing the form fields required to
  edit the rule instance configuration, based on the context.
- `getIcon`: Returns the Font Awesome CSS class for the rule icon.
- `getName`: Returns the rule localized name.
- `getRuleCategoryKey`: Returns the key that identifies the category of the
  rule.
- `getRuleKey`: Returns the key that identifies the rule. The rule instances of
  this rule are identified by their rule key.
- `getShortDescription`: Returns the rule localized short description.
- `getSummary`: Returns the rule instance localized summary.
- `importData`: Imports any additional data added by this rule when the rule
  instance is imported.
- `isInstantiable`: Returns `true` if the rule can be used more than once with
  different values for a user segment.
- `isVisible`: Returns `true` if the rule is visible.
- `processRule`: Returns the result of evaluating the rule form fields in the
  context of the request and response.
- `supportsOfflineEvaluation`: Returns `true` if the rule can be evaluated
  offline (without the user request in real time). If this is set to `true`, the
  method `evaluate(Map, RuleInstance, AnonymousUser)` should be implemented.

**Note:** If you're planning on developing a social rule type that classifies
users based on their social network profile, it's important to remember that
they will not work properly unless the specific social network's SSO (Single
Sign On) is enabled and configured properly. Visit the
[Social Rules](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-audience-targeting-rules#social-rules)
section for more details.

To show how easy it is to modify a rule's behavior, you'll make a quick change
in your rule's class. When extending the `BaseJSPRule` class, the category of
the rule is not set, by default. To change your rule's category (i.e., the
category your rule selectable from in the Audience Targeting app), add the
following:

    @Override
    public String getRuleCategoryKey() {

        return SessionAttributesRuleCategory.KEY;
    }

Now your rule's category is set to Session Attributes. Available category
classes include `BehaviourRuleCategory`, `SessionAttributesRuleCategory`,
`SocialRuleCategory`, and `UserAttributesRoleCategory`.

![Figure 1: This example Weather rule was modified to reside in the Session Attributes category.](../../images-dxp/new-category-rule.png)

Now that you've modified some basic features in your `-Rule` class, you'll need
to develop the UI for your rule's configuration. As you read earlier, the second
component of your rule is its UI configuration, which is used to show the rule's
form. If your `-Rule` class is already extending `BaseJSPRule`, your rule
already supports using JSP pages. If you used the `contenttargetingrule` Blade
CLI template, your project is already extending `BaseJSPRule` and has a default
`view.jsp` file already configured.

To view a sample rule and its UI configuration, download the sample
[weather rule](https://customer.liferay.com/documents/10738/200086/weather.zip/45a7d464-a3e9-49e9-bf92-1ba34e009c3c).

If you wanted, for example, to create user segment rules based on the type of
weather a user is experiencing, you could create a drop-down menu that lets the
administrator select a weather type to associate with that user segment rule.
Here's a code snippet from the weather rule's JSP template (`view.jsp`) that
could be applied to this example:

    <%
    Map<String, Object> context = (Map<String, Object>)request.getAttribute("context");

    String weather = (String)context.get("weather");
    %>

    <aui:fieldset>
        <aui:select name="weather" value="<%= weather %>">
            <aui:option label="sunny" value="sunny" />
            <aui:option label="clouds" value="clouds" />
            <aui:option label="mist" value="mist" />
            <aui:option label="snow" value="snow" />
        </aui:select>
    </aui:fieldset>

This JSP code creates a `select` drop-down box with the name `weather`.
Then it specifies several options associated with different types of weather.
You could borrow from this JSP code and change the name and labels for a
`select` drop-down box and values appropriate for your rule plugin.

![Figure 2: This example rule uses a `select` drop-down box.](../../images-dxp/select-box-rule.png)

tutorials.

Now you'll jump back into modifying your rule's behavior via the `-Rule` class.
You'll dive further into the sample weather rule and find what is necessary to
make the JSP code work with the Rule Java class.

1. Find the `processRule` method in the `WeatherRule` class. This method is
   called when you click *Save* after selecting your rule in the Rules form. The
   portlet's request and response, the rule instance's ID, and the values from
   the form can be used by this method.

    In some cases, you may need to retrieve info from the portlet's request
    and response or the rule's ID. This tutorial demonstrates using the
    `values` parameter. This parameter represents all the values on the form
    you're saving. 

2. If you wanted to process one of the form's values, you could do that from the
   `processRule` method. You'll need to return the string value for the selected
   entity you chose for your rule type. For example, recall the JSP code example
   you studied earlier. To retrieve the selected value from the select box,
   you'd need to retrieve the weather value:

        @Override
        public String processRule(
            PortletRequest request, PortletResponse response, String id,
            Map<String, String> values) {

            return values.get("weather");
        }

    The return value is stored in the `typeSettings` of the rule instance. The
    `typeSettings` field is managed by the framework in the Rule Instance table.

3. The next method to inspect in the weather rule is the `populateContext`
   method. This method takes the value the user selected and injects it into the
   `context` map parameter. For example, the following `populateContext` method
   populates a `weather` context variable with the `weather` value of the
   `values` map parameter.

        @Override
        protected void populateContext(
            RuleInstance ruleInstance, Map<String, Object> context,
            Map<String, String> values) {

            String weather = "sunny";

            if (!values.isEmpty()) {
                // Values from Request

                weather = values.get("weather");
            }
            else if (ruleInstance != null) {
                // Values from Database

                weather = ruleInstance.getTypeSettings();
            }

            context.put("weather", weather);
        }

    In this example implementation, this method checks if the values are
    available from the request. If they're not available, it checks for the
    values in the database.  Then the context map is updated by assigning the
    string key to the object value. 

Excellent! You've processed your rule and populated the rule's context. The last
step you'll need to take is specifying what your rule should evaluate. The
evaluation process determines whether a user matches the rule.

1. Find the `evaluate` method in the `WeatherRule` class. There is logic that
   obtains the runtime user's value for what you plan to evaluate.

        ...
        String userWeather = getUserWeather(anonymousUser);

    You can look at this method's code in the
    [downloadable ZIP file](https://customer.liferay.com/documents/10738/200086/weather.zip/45a7d464-a3e9-49e9-bf92-1ba34e009c3c)
    for the sample weather rule.

2. The weather rule now must retrieve the value stored in the type settings by
   using the `processRule` method.

        String weather = ruleInstance.getTypeSettings();

3. Now that the rule has both the user's value and the rule's value, it should
   check whether they match. If they match, return `true`; otherwise, return
   `false`.

        if (Validator.equals(userWeather, weather)) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;

4. Finally, deploy your rule plugin to the Liferay server. Your new rule is
   fully functional, and the UI you've defined is added to the Add/Edit User
   Segment form so that administrators can set a value for that specific user
   segment.

Now you've inspected a fully functional rule and have the knowledge to
create your own.

Here are some things to consider as you implement and deploy rules:

- If you deploy your rule into a production environment, you may want to
consider adding your values to the cache (e.g., weather in different locations),
since obtaining the same value on every request is very inefficient and could
result in slowing down your portal.

- As an alternative to storing complex information in the `typeSettings` field
which is managed by the framework in the Rule Instance table, you may want to
consider persisting to a database by using 
[Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/business-logic-and-data-access),
which is supported in the Rule plugins. 

- You can override the `BaseJSPRule.deleteData` method in your `-Rule`, so that
it deletes any data associated with the rule that is currently being deleted.

- If your rule handles data or references to data that can be staged (e.g., a
reference to a page or web content article), you may need to override the
`BaseJSPRule.exportData` and `BaseJSPRule.importData` methods, to manage the
content properly.

You now know how to create a custom rule type for your Audience Targeting
application.
