# Content Targeting Rule Template [](id=content-targeting-rule-template)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a Liferay Content Targeting Rule
application as a Liferay module. To create a Liferay Content Targeting Rule
application as a module, use a command like the following:

    blade create -t contenttargetingrule -p com.liferay -c Weather weather

The command above creates a Content Targeting Rule project named `weather` in
the current directory. You specified the prefix for the package name, which is
set to `com.liferay.content.targeting.rule` and your portlet component class
name to `WeatherRule`. Note that in that class, you're creating a service of
type `com.liferay.content.targeting.api.model.Rule` and extending the
`com.liferay.content.targeting.api.model.BaseJSPRule` class. Here, *service*
means an OSGi service, not a Liferay API. Another way to say *service type* is
to say *component type*.

After running the command above, your project's directory structure looks like
this:

- `weather`
    - `src`
        - `main`
            - `java`
                - `com/liferay/content/targeting/rule`
                    - `WeatherRule.java`
            - `resources`
                - `content`
                    - `Language.properties`
                - `META-INF`
                    - `resources`
                        - `view.jsp`
    - `bnd.bnd`
    - `build.gradle`

The generated module is a working application and is deployable to a Liferay
instance. To build upon the generated app, modify the project by adding logic
and additional files to the folders outlined above.
