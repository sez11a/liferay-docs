The Frontend JS Numsequences Module was originally housed in the 
`liferay-portal/modules/apps/modules/` directory. To build and deploy the 
application:

1. Navigate to the `liferay-portal/modules` directory of your Portal repo and 
   place the `frontend-js-numsequences-web` module inside.
   
2. Navigate to the `frontend-js-numsequences-web` root directory and run 
   `gradle clean deploy` to deploy the module to your server.
