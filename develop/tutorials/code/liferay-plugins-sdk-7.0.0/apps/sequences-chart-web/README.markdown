The Sequences Chart Portlet was originally housed in the 
`liferay-portal/modules/apps/math/` directory. To build and deploy the 
application:

1. Create a `math` folder in the `liferay-portal/modules/apps` directory of your
   Portal repo and place the `sequences-chart-web` app inside.
   
2. Navigate to the `sequences-chart-web` root directory and run 
   `gradle clean deploy` to deploy the app to your server.
