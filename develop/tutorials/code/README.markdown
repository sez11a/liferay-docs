Put sample code in a folder named the same as the folder of the article which
references the code.

For example, plugins for *User and Organization* articles belong in a folder
named `01-users-and-organizations/`. Their directory structure would look like
this:

- ``01-users-and-organizations/`
    - `sample-01/`
        - `some-portlet/`
            ...
    - `[sample-02/]`
        - `[some-portlet/]`
            ...
