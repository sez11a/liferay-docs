# JSF

Liferay supports developing and deploying JSF portlets on Liferay Portal by
using
[Liferay Faces](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/overview).
Liferay Faces provides a bridge that supports deploying JSF web applications as
portlets on Liferay 7.0. Liferay Faces Bridge makes developing JSF portlets as
similar as possible to JSF web app development. In this section of tutorials,
you'll learn the portlet development process and how to use JSF in Liferay 7.
For a comprehenvise demo for the JSF component suite, visit the
[Liferay Faces Showcase](http://www.liferayfaces.org/web/guest/showcase).
