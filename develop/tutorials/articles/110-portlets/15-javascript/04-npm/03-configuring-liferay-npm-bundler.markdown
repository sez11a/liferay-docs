# Configuring liferay-npm-bundler [](id=configuring-liferay-npm-bundler)

The liferay-npm-bundler is configured using a `.npmbundlerrc` file in the 
portlet project's root folder. You can manually configure the `.npmbundlerrc` 
file, or you can use a configuration preset. You can use the configuration 
presets linked to in this section as a guide to create your own custom 
configurations.

This tutorial explains the `.npmbundlerrc` file's structure, and shows how to 
use the available presets to configure the liferay-npm-bundler.

You can start by learning the `.npmbundlerrc` file's structure next.

## Understanding the .npmbundlerrc File's Structure [](id=understanding-the-npmbundlerrc-file-structure)

The `.npmbundlerrc` file is broken down into three possible phase definitions: 
*pre-process*, *post-process*, and *babel*. These phase definitions are 
explained in more detail below:

**Pre-Process Phase Definition:** Defined with the `plugins` property. Specifies 
plugins to run before the Babel phase is run.

**Babel Phase Definition:** Defined with the `.babelrc` definition. Specifies 
the `.babelrc` file to use when running Babel through the package's `.js` files. 

+$$$

**Note:** During this phase, Babel is used to transform package files 
(for example, to convert them to AMD format, if necessary) and not to transpile 
them. Though, in theory, you could transpile them too, if you wanted, by 
configuring the proper plugins.

$$$

**Post-Process Phase Definition:** Defined with the `post-plugins` property. An 
alternative to using the *pre-process* phase, this specifies plugins to run 
after the Babel phase has completed. 

An example `.npmbundlerrc` file configuration is shown below:

    {
      "exclude":{
        "*":[
            (list of glob expressions excluding files)
        ],
        "some-package-name":[
            (same as wildcard format (`*`) contents below)
        ],
        "another-package-name@1.0.10":[
            (same as wildcard format (`*`) contents below)
        ]
      },
      "output":(relative path to output directory),
      "process-serially":(true|false),
      "*" : {
        "plugins": [
          <list of plugins>
        ],
        ".babelrc": {
          <a standard .babelrc file>
        },
        "post-plugins": [
          <list of plugins>
        ]
      },
      "some-package-name" : {
        (same as wildcard format (`*`) contents above)
      },
      "some-package-name@1.1.10" : {
        (same as wildcard format (`*`) contents above)
      }
      ...
    }

+$$$

**Note:** Not all definition formats (`*`, `some-package-name`, and 
`some-package-name@version`) shown in the file above, are required. In most 
cases, the wildcard definition (`*`) is enough. The non-wildcard formats 
(`some-package-name` and `some-package-name@version`) are for rare exceptions 
for packages that require a more specific configuration than the wildcard 
definition can provide.

$$$

Below is an explanation of the `.npmbundlerrc` file's configuration:

*exclude:* defines files to exclude from bundling from all or specific packages.

*output:* by default the bundled packages are written to the standard Gradle 
resources folder: `build/resources/main/META-INF/resources`. Set this value to 
override the default output folder.

*process-serially:* Sets whether to process dependency packages in parallel, 
leveraging Node.js asynchronous model, or one by one. The default value is 
`false`, so that everything gets processed in parallel, but you can disable this 
in case you get EMFILE errors due to opening too many files at the same time.

*list of plugins:* a comma separated list of strings defining the 
liferay-npm-bundler plugins to call.

*standard .babelrc file:* a `.babelrc` file, as defined in [Babel's documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/), that gets passed to 
Babel when called by liferay-npm-bundler.

*package name:* The npm package's name. The configuration under its scope is 
only applied to packages with this name and *any* version.

*version:* The npm package's version. The configuration under its 
`some-package name@version` scope is only applied to packages with the specified 
*package name* and *version*.

Now that you know the structure of the `.npmbundlerrc` file, you can learn 
about the available configuration presets next.

## liferay-npm-bundler Configuration Presets [](id=liferay-npm-bundler-configuration-presets)

The liferay-npm-bundler comes with default configuration presets that bundle 
several plugin types. You can use these presets to quickly configure your 
`.npmbundlerrc` file. The following configuration presets are available: 

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-amd](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-amd)

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-angular](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-angular)

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-isomorphic](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-isomorphic)

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-react](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-react)

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard)

-  [Liferay-npm-bundler-preset-vue](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-vue)

Below is an example `.npmbundlerrc` file, that uses the *standard* 
configuration preset:

    {
        "preset": "liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard"
    }

+$$$

**Note:** the `liferay-npm-bundler` prefix may be omitted from the npm package 
name in your `.npmbundlerrc` file.

$$$

If you run liferay-npm-bundler with this file, it applies the [config file](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/blob/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard/config.json) 
found in `liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard`:

    {
      "*": {
        "plugins": [
          "replace-browser-modules"
        ],
        ".babelrc": {
          "presets": ["liferay-standard"]
        }
      }
    }

The [`replace-browser-modules` plugin ](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/blob/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-plugin-replace-browser-modules/README.md) runs during the pre-process phase, replacing the 
server side files, for each of the project's dependencies that has a browser 
section in its `package.json`, with their browser version counterparts.

+$$$

**Note:** You can override configuration preset values by adding your own 
configuration to your project's `.npmbundlerrc` file. For instance, using 
configuration preset example above, you can define your own `.babelrc` value in 
`.npmbundlerrc` file to override the defined "liferay-standard" babelrc preset. 

$$$

The [`liferay-standard` preset] (https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-liferay-standard) 
applies the following plugins:

-  [babel-plugin-normalize-requires](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-normalize-requires)

- [babel-plugin-transform-node-env-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-node-env-inline)

-  [babel-plugin-wrap-modules-amd](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-wrap-modules-amd)

-  [babel-plugin-name-amd-modules](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-name-amd-modules)

-  [babel-plugin-namespace-amd-define](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-namespace-amd-define)

Babel uses the plugins above to do the following:

- Remove trailing JavaScript strings from `require()` calls in the npm packages.

- Replace occurrences of `process.env.NODE_ENV` with its literal value.

- Wrap modules with an `AMD define()` call.

- Give a canonical name to each AMD module based on its package and relative 
  path inside it.

- Prefix `define()` calls with `Liferay.Loader`.

Now you know the available configuration presets for `.npmbundlerrc` and 
how they work. Next you can learn how to configure your `.npmbundlerrc` file to 
use a configuration preset.

## Using liferay-npm-bundler Configuration Presets [](id=using-liferay-npm-bundler-configuration-presets)

Follow these steps to use a liferay-npm-bundler configuration preset in your 
`.npmbundlerrc` file:

1.  Create a `.npmbundlerrc` file in your projectâ€™s root folder, if it doesn't 
    already exist.

2.  Install the liferay-npm-bundler configuration preset. For example, you can 
    use the following command to install the standard configuration:

        npm install --save-dev liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard

3.  Finally, define which configuration preset to use. The example below uses 
    the standard configuration preset:

        {
            "preset": "liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard"
        }

Now you know how to configure the liferay-npm-bundler!
