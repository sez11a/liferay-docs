# Liferay Soy Portlet [](id=liferay-soy-portlet)

Soy portlets are an extension of Liferay's MVC portlet. This gives you access to
all of the MVC Portlet functionality you are familar with, and you get the added
bonus of using Soy templates for writing your Front-End, rather than JSPs. Soy
templates are an easy-to-use templating language that also allows you to use
MetalJS components. With all these benefits and more, Soy portlets can be a good
Front-End tool to have in your utility belt.

You can learn about Liferay MVC portlets in the [Creating an MVC Portlet](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-an-mvc-portlet)
tutorial.

This section covers how to implement a Soy portlet.
