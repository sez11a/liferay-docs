# Adding Comments to your App [](id=adding-comments-to-your-app)

A key social feature you can add to your app is the ability to comment on
an asset. Allowing users to leave comments and feedback on a user's post, or
something you have created, is invaluable. It brings new life to your app, and
lets it grow organically. You can add comments to your app by leveraging
Liferay's asset framework. What's more, it can be implemented in just a few
steps!

This tutorial shows you how to add the comment feature for your application's
content.

Follow these steps to add comments to your app:

1.  Make sure your custom entity is [asset enabled](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/adding-updating-and-deleting-assets-for-custom-entities).

2.  Choose a view to display the comments in. You can display the comments
    component in your portlet's view, or if you've implemented
    [asset rendering](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/rendering-an-asset),
    you can display it in the full content view in the Asset Publisher portlet.

3.  Include the Liferay-UI taglib and Portlet taglib declarations in your JSP:

        <%@ taglib prefix="liferay-ui" uri="http://liferay.com/tld/ui" %>      
        <%@ taglib prefix="portlet" uri="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0" %>

4.  In your entity's view, use `ParamUtil` to get the ID of the entity
    from the render request. Then you can create an entity object using your
    `-LocalServiceUtil` class. Below is an example configuration:

        <%
        long entryId = ParamUtil.getLong(renderRequest, "entryId");
        entry = EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntry(entryId);
        %>

5.  Create a collapsible panel for the comments using the
    `liferay-ui:panel-container` and `liferay-ui:panel` tags. This lets your
    users hide the potentially long comments on the page, so the discussion
    area doesn't visually take precedence over the content. Below is an example
    configuration:

        <liferay-ui:panel-container extended="<%=false%>"
          id="guestbookCollaborationPanelContainer" persistState="<%=true%>">
          <liferay-ui:panel collapsible="<%=true%>" extended="<%=true%>"
            id="guestbookCollaborationPanel" persistState="<%=true%>"
            title="Collaboration">

6.  Next, create a URL for the discussion using the `portlet:actionURL` tag, as
    shown in the example below:

        <portlet:actionURL name="invokeTaglibDiscussion" var="discussionURL" />

7.  Finally, add the implementation of the discussion itself with the
    `liferay-ui:discussion` tag. Pass the current URL using the `redirect`
    attribute, so the user can return to the JSP after making a comment. You can
    use `PortalUtil.getCurrentURL((renderRequest))` to get the current URL from
    the `request` object. Below is an example configuration:

        <liferay-ui:discussion className="<%=Entry.class.getName()%>"
          classPK="<%=entry.getEntryId()%>"
          formAction="<%=discussionURL%>" formName="fm2"
          ratingsEnabled="<%=true%>" redirect="<%=currentURL%>"
          userId="<%=entry.getUserId()%>" />

      </liferay-ui:panel>
    </liferay-ui:panel-container>

If you haven't already connected your portlet's view to the JSP for your entity,
you can refer [here](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/relating-assets#creating-a-url-to-your-new-jsp)
to see how to connect your portlet's main view JSP to your entity's view JSP.

Great! Now you know how to let users comment on content in your asset enabled
portlets.
