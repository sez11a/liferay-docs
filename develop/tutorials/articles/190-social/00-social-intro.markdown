# Social [](id=social)

You've worked hard on your app and now you need to know what users think of your 
app's content. @product@'s social framework lets users provide feedback on 
content, share that content with others across social networks, and subscribe to 
and receive notifications on content, so they can stay up to date on the latest 
and greatest that you have to share. 

The tutorials that follow show you how to take advantage of @product@'s social 
framework to enable these features in your own app.
