# Developing Plugins with Liferay IDE [](id=liferay-ide-lp-6-2-develop-tutorial)

The best Liferay-specific development tool is Liferay IDE, a fully featured
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Eclipse. Even if you're a
grizzled veteran Java developer, consider using Liferay IDE when you're doing a
lot of development for your Liferay Portal instance. When Liferay IDE is paired
with the Plugins SDK or Maven and a Liferay runtime environment, you have a one
stop development environment where you can develop your Liferay plugins, build
them, and deploy them to your Liferay instance. 

Liferay IDE is an extension for Eclipse IDE and supports development of plugin
projects for the Liferay Portal platform. You can install Liferay IDE bundled
with Eclipse or as a set of Eclipse plugins from an update site. The latest
version of Liferay IDE supports development of portlets, hooks, layout
templates, themes, and Ext plugins. To use Liferay IDE, you need the Eclipse
Java EE developer package using Indigo or a later version. 

In this section's tutorials we'll show you how to install Liferay IDE, set up
projects for your applications, and deploy them to your portal.
