# JavaScript [](id=javascript)

Liferay 7.0 brings with it quite a few updates to the front-end development 
tools. You can now organize and share your code in a more logical way using 
the new JavaScript standard module syntax(ES2015), thanks to our
[AMD Module Config Generator](https://github.com/liferay/lfr-module-config-generator) 
and [AMD Module Loader](https://github.com/liferay/lfr-amd-loader). You'll also 
be able to use any AMD compliant third party libraries in your JavaScript 
modules. You can read more about the new ECMAScript 2015 syntax updates [here](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), 
if you're not sure whether you want to make the move yet.

This section of tutorials explores how you can leverage the ES2015 JavaScript 
standard syntax and features in Liferay. So go ahead and jump right in, and see
what you can do, using the new front-end tools that Liferay has to offer!
