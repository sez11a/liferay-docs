# Introduction [](id=intro)

Liferay 7.0 brings with it quite a few updates to the front-end development 
tools. You can organize and share your code in a more logical way using 
the new JavaScript standard module syntax thanks to our config generator and AMD 
loader. You'll also be able to use any of your third party Libraries that are 
AMD compliant.

The JavaScript tutorials use code from the [frontend-js-numsequences-web module](../../code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/portlets/frontend-js-numsequences-web), 
[Sequences Explorer Portlet](../../code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/apps/sequences-explorer-web)
, and [Sequences Chart Portlet](../../code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/apps/sequences-chart-web). 
Using these modules and portlets as an example, you'll learn how to implement 
the new ECMAScript 2015 features in your applications and JavaScript.
