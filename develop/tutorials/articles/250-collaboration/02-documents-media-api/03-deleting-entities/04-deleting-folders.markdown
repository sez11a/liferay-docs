# Deleting Folders [](id=deleting-folders)

Deleting folders is similar to 
[deleting files](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/deleting-files). 
There are two methods you can use to delete a folder. Click each method to see 
its Javadoc: 

-   [`deleteFolder(long folderId)`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#deleteFolder-long-) 

-   [`deleteFolder(long repositoryId, long parentFolderId, String name)`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#deleteFolder-long-long-java.lang.String-) 

Which method you use is up to you---they both delete a folder. 

The following example comes from @product@'s 
[`EditFolderMVCActionCommand`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/document-library/document-library-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/document/library/web/internal/portlet/action/EditFolderMVCActionCommand.java) 
class. This class implements almost all the `Folder` actions that the Documents 
and Media UI supports. This class contains a `deleteFolders` method that deletes 
one or more folders by calling the `DLAppService` method 
`deleteFolder(folderId)`. 

The `deleteFolders` method first gets any folder IDs in the request. It then 
iterates through each, moving the folder to the 
[Recycle Bin](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/restoring-deleted-assets) 
if the `moveToTrash` flag is `true`, or deleting the folder via the 
`DLAppService` method `deleteFolder(folderId)` if the flag is `false`: 

    protected void deleteFolders(
                    ActionRequest actionRequest, boolean moveToTrash)
            throws Exception {

            long[] deleteFolderIds = null;

            long folderId = ParamUtil.getLong(actionRequest, "folderId");

            if (folderId > 0) {
                    deleteFolderIds = new long[] {folderId};
            }
            else {
                    deleteFolderIds = ParamUtil.getLongValues(
                            actionRequest, "rowIdsFolder");
            }

            ...

            for (long deleteFolderId : deleteFolderIds) {
                    if (moveToTrash) {
                            // Move the folder to the Recycle Bin
                    }
                    else {
                            _dlAppService.deleteFolder(deleteFolderId);
                    }
            }

            ...
    }

Note that you don't have to support the Recycle Bin in your delete operations. 
If you want to, however, see the tutorial on 
[moving entities to the Recycle Bin](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/moving-entities-to-the-recycle-bin).
