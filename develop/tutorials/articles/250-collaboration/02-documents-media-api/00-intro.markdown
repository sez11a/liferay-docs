# Documents and Media API [](id=documents-and-media-api)

@product@'s Documents and Media library lets users upload files to the portal 
and then use and manage them as desired. For example, users can include portal 
files in content, organize them in folders, edit and collaborate on them with 
other users, and more. See the 
[user guide](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-documents-and-media) 
for more information on the Documents and Media library's features. 

A powerful API underlies the Documents and Media library's functionality. You 
can leverage this API in your own apps to provide access to this functionality. 
For example, you could create an app that lets users upload files to the 
Documents and Media library. Your app could even let users update, delete, and 
copy portal files. 

The tutorials in this section show you how to use the Documents and Media 
library's API. Note that this is a relatively large API and it may seem daunting 
at first. To keep backwards compatibility, the API has different entry points 
and multiple methods or classes with similar functionality. Fortunately, you 
don't need to learn all of them. These tutorials therefore focus on the API's 
most useful classes and methods.
