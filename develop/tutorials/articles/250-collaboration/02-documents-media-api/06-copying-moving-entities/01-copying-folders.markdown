# Copying Folders [](id=copying-folders)

The Documents and Media API lets you copy folders within a repository. You 
can't, however, copy a folder between different repositories. Also note that 
copying a folder also copies its contents. 

To copy a folder, use the 
[`DLAppService`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html) 
method `copyFolder`: 

    copyFolder(long repositoryId, long sourceFolderId, long parentFolderId, String name, 
            String description, ServiceContext serviceContext)

For a full description of the method and its parameters, see its 
[Javadoc](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#copyFolder-long-long-long-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.ServiceContext-). 

Follow these steps to use this method to copy a folder: 

1.  Get a reference to `DLAppService`: 

        @Reference
        private DLAppService _dlAppService;

    For more information on this, see the section on 
    [getting a service reference](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/getting-started-with-the-documents-and-media-api#getting-a-service-reference) 
    in the getting started tutorial. 

2.  Get the data needed to populate the `copyFolder` method's arguments. How you 
    do this depends on your use case. The copy operation in this example takes 
    place in the default Site repository and retains the folder's existing name 
    and description. It therefore needs the folder's group ID (to specify the 
    default site repository), name, and description. Also note that because the 
    destination folder in this example is the repository's root folder, the 
    parent folder ID isn't needed---@product@ supplies a constant for specifying 
    a repository's root folder. 

    In the following code, 
    [`ParamUtil`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ParamUtil.html) 
    gets the folder's ID from the request (`javax.portlet.ActionRequest`), and 
    the service reference's 
    [`getFolder`](/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#getFolder-long-) 
    method gets the corresponding folder object. The folder's `getGroupId()`, 
    `getName()`, and `getDescription()` methods then get the folder's group ID, 
    name, and description, respectively: 

        long folderId = ParamUtil.getLong(actionRequest, "folderId");

        Folder folder = _dlAppService.getFolder(folderId);
        long groupId = folder.getGroupId();
        String folderName = folder.getName();
        String folderDescription = folder.getDescription();

        ServiceContext serviceContext = ServiceContextFactory.getInstance(
                    DLFolder.class.getName(), actionRequest);

    For more information on getting repository and folder IDs, see the 
    [getting started tutorial's](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/getting-started-with-the-documents-and-media-api) 
    sections on specifying repositories and folders. For more information on 
    `ServiceContext`, see the tutorial 
    [Understanding ServiceContext](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/understanding-servicecontext). 

3.  Call the service reference's `copyFolder` method with the data from the 
    previous step. Note that this example uses the 
    [`DLFolderConstants`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/model/DLFolderConstants.html) 
    constant `DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` to specify the repository's root folder 
    as the destination folder: 

        _dlAppService.copyFolder(
                groupId, folderId, DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID, 
                folderName, folderDescription, serviceContext);

Keep in mind that you can change any of these values to suit your copy 
operation. For example, if your copy takes place in a repository other than the 
default Site repository, you would specify that repository's ID in place of the 
group ID. You could also specify a different destination folder, and/or change 
the new folder's name and/or description.
