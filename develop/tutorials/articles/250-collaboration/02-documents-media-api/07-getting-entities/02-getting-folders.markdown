# Getting Folders [](id=getting-folders)

The Documents and Media API can get folders in a similar way to getting files.
The main difference is that folder retrieval methods may have an additional
argument to tell the system whether to include *mount folders*. Mount folders
are mount points for external repositories (e.g. Alfresco or SharePoint) that
appear as regular folders in a Site's default repository. They let users
navigate seamlessly between repositories. To account for this, some folder
retrieval methods include the boolean parameter `includeMountFolders`. Setting
this parameter to `true` includes mount folders in the results, while omitting
it or setting it to `false` excludes them. 

For example, to get a list of a parent folder's subfolders from a repository, 
including any mount folders, use the 
[`getFolders`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#getFolders-long-long-boolean-) 
method: 

    getFolders(long repositoryId, long parentFolderId, boolean includeMountFolders)

Follow these steps to use this method to get the folders from a parent folder. 
Note that the example in these steps gets the folders in the default Site 
repository's root folder: 

1.  Get a reference to `DLAppService`: 

        @Reference
        private DLAppService _dlAppService;

    For more information on this, see the section on 
    [getting a service reference](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/getting-started-with-the-documents-and-media-api#getting-a-service-reference) 
    in the getting started tutorial. 

2.  Get the data needed to populate the method's arguments any way you wish.
    This `getFolders` method needs a repository ID, a parent folder ID, and
    a boolean value that indicates whether to include mount folders in the
    results. To specify the default site repository, you can use the group ID
    as the repository ID. This example gets the group ID from the request
    (`javax.portlet.ActionRequest`) via 
    [`ParamUtil`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ParamUtil.html): 

        long groupId = ParamUtil.getLong(actionRequest, "groupId");

    It's also possible to get the group ID via the 
    [`ThemeDisplay`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/theme/ThemeDisplay.html). 
    Calling the `ThemeDisplay` method `getScopeGroupId()` gets the ID of your 
    app's current site (group). For more information, see the 
    [Data Scopes tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/data-scopes). 

        ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay) request.getAttribute(WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);
        long groupId = themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId();

    Note that getting the parent folder ID isn't necessary because this example 
    uses the root folder, for which @product@ provides a constant. Also, the 
    boolean value can be provided directly---it doesn't need to be retrieved 
    from somewhere. For more information on getting repository and folder IDs, 
    see the 
    [getting started tutorial's](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/getting-started-with-the-documents-and-media-api) 
    sections on specifying repositories and folders. 

3.  Call the service reference's `getFolders` method with the data from the 
    previous step and any other values you want to provide. Note that this 
    example uses `DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` to specify the 
    repository's root folder as the parent folder. It also uses `true` to 
    include any mount folders in the results: 

        _dlAppService.getFolders(groupId, DLFolderConstants.DEFAULT_PARENT_FOLDER_ID, true)

Note that this is one of many methods you can use to get folders. The rest are 
listed in the 
[`DLAppService` Javadoc](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html).
