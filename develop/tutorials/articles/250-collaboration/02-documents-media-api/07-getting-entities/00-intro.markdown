# Getting Entities [](id=getting-entities)

The Documents and Media API contains many methods for getting entities from a 
repository. Most methods in 
[`DLAppService`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html) 
are for getting single entities (e.g., a file or folder), a collection of 
entities that match certain characteristics, or the number of such entities. 
Because there are so many similar methods for getting entities, these tutorials
don't describe them all in detail. All of them are covered in the 
[reference documentation](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html).
