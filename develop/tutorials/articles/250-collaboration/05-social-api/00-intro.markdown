# Social API [](id=social-api)

@product@'s social API lets users interact with content throughout the portal, 
including content in your custom app. For example, users can provide feedback on 
content, share that content with others, subscribe to notifications on content, 
and more. These features let users stay up to date on the latest and greatest 
that you have to share. 

The tutorials that follow show you how to take advantage of this social API to 
enable these features in your own app.
