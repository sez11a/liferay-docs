# Resolving ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError in OSGi Bundles [](id=resolving-classnotfoundexception-and-noclassdeffounderror-in-osgi-bundles)

Understanding a `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` in non-OSGi
environments is straightforward. 

-   `ClassNotFoundException`: thrown when looking up a class that isn't in the
    classpath or using an invalid name to look up a class.
-   `NoClassDefFoundError`: occurs when a compiled class references
    another class that isn't in the run time classpath.

In OSGi environments, there are additional cases in which a
`ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` can occur. Here are two
common cases:

1.  Bundle doesn't import the class' package.
2.  Class no longer exists in the imported package.

This tutorial explains how to handle each case.

## Case 1: Bundle doesn't import the class' package [](id=case-1-bundle-doesnt-import-the-class-package)

For a bundle (module or WAB) to consume a another bundle's exported class, the consuming bundle
must import (e.g., in an
`Import-Package` header in your bundle's `bnd.bnd` file) the exported package to which the class belongs. If the consumer
accesses the class without importing it, a `ClassNotFoundException` or
`NoClassDefFoundError` occurs.

In the consuming bundle, make sure to import the correct package--check the
package name. If the package import is correct but you still get the exception
or error, the class might no longer exist in the package.

## Case 2: Class no longer exists in the package [](id=case-2-class-no-longer-exists-in-the-package)

In OSGi runtime environments, bundles can change and come and go. If you
reference or look up another bundle's class and that class has been removed, a
`NoClassDefFoundError` or `ClassNotFoundException` occurs.
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guards against this scenario. It
dictates that removing a class from an exported package constitutes a new major
version for that package. Neglecting to increment the package's major version
breaks dependent bundles. 

For example, a bundle that consumes class `com.foo.Bar` specifies package import
`com.foo;version=[1.0.0, 2.0.0)`--the bundle uses `com.foo` package versions
from `1.0.0` up to but not including `2.0.0`. The first part of the version
number (the `1` in `1.0.0`) represents the *major* version. The consuming bundle
doesn't expect any *major* breaking changes, such as a class being removed.
Removing class `com.foo.Bar` from package `com.foo` constitutes a major breaking
change. Removing the class without incrementing the major version number breaks
consuming bundles. 

The example consuming bundle doesn't expect any major breaking changes, such as
a class being removed. If the authoring developer removes class `Bar` from
`com.foo` without incrementing the package to a new major version (e.g.,
`2.0.0`), a `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` occurs when other
bundles look up or reference that class.

Here are two ways to resolve the issue:

1.  Request that the providing bundle owner 
    increment the bundle's major version, and as a result honor Semantic
    Versioning. This solution is ideal because it can resolve the issue for all
    consumers. 

2.  Refine the consuming bundle's package import to a range up to but not 
    including the broken version. For example, if you're consuming a package
    starting at version `1.0.0` but version `1.3.0` breaks you, specify the
    range `[1.0.0, 1.3.0)`.

Now you know how to resolve common situations involving `ClassNotFoundException`
or `NoClassDefFoundError`. For additional information on `NoClassDefFoundError`
