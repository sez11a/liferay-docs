# Data Upgrades and Verifiers [](id=data-upgrades-and-verifiers)

Your app goes through various stages of development, because you're constantly
trying to improve it. You add new features, remove features, enhance features,
reorganize the code, and do whatever you can to respond to what your users want
and make your application the best it can be. To transition users to new and
improved versions of your software, you need to take them through the process of
upgrading. 

Liferay provides a robust upgrade framework for you to use. Here you'll learn
how to create an upgrade process for your application, as well as how to migrate
your existing upgrade processes to use the new upgrade framework.
