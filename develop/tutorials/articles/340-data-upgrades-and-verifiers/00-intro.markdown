# Data Upgrades and Verifiers [](id=data-upgrades-and-verifiers)

Your app goes through various stages of development, because you're constantly
trying to improve it. You add new features, remove features, enhance features,
reorganize the code, and do whatever you can to respond to what your users want
and make your application the best it can be. To transition users to new and
improved versions of your software, you need to take them through the process of
upgrading. You'll also want to verify and fix any integrity problems found in 
the database, while changes are being made to your app.

Liferay provides a robust upgrade and verifier framework for you to use. Here 
you'll learn how to create an upgrade process for your application, as well as 
how to create a verification process for your application.
