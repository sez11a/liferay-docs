# Rendering Web Pages in Your iOS App [](id=rendering-web-pages-in-your-ios-app)

[The Rendering Web Content](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/rendering-web-content-in-your-ios-app) 
tutorial shows you how to display 
[web content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/introduction-web-content) 
from a @product@ site in your iOS app. Displaying content is great, but what if 
you want to display an entire page? No problem! 
[Web Screenlet](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/web-screenlet-for-ios) 
lets you display any web page. You can even customize the page by injecting 
local or remote JavaScript and CSS files. When combined with @product@'s 
server-side customization features (e.g., 
[Application Display Templates](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/styling-apps-and-assets)), 
Web Screenlet gives you almost limitless possibilities for displaying web pages 
in your iOS apps. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Web Screenlet to display web pages in 
your iOS app. 

## Inserting Web Screenlet in Your App [](id=inserting-web-screenlet-in-your-app)

Inserting Web Screenlet in your app is the same as 
[inserting any Screenlet in your app](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-screenlets-in-ios-apps): 

1.  In Interface Builder, insert a new view (`UIView`) in a new view controller. 
    This new view should be nested under the view controller's existing view. 

2.  With the new view selected, open the Identity inspector and set the view's 
    Custom Class to `WebScreenlet`. 

3.  Set any constraints that you want for the Screenlet in the scene. 

The exact steps for configuring Web Screenlet are unique to Web Screenlet. 
First, you'll conform your view controller to Web Screenlet's delegate protocol. 

## Conforming to Web Screenlet's Delegate Protocol [](id=conforming-to-web-screenlets-delegate-protocol)

To use any Screenlet, you must conform the class of the view controller that 
contains it to the Screenlet's delegate protocol. Web Screenlet's delegate 
protocol is `WebScreenletDelegate`. Follow these steps to conform your view 
controller to `WebScreenletDelegate`: 

1.  Import `LiferayScreens` and set your view controller to adopt the 
    `WebScreenletDelegate` protocol: 

        import UIKit
        import LiferayScreens

        class ViewController: UIViewController, WebScreenletDelegate {...

2.  Implement the `WebScreenletDelegate` method `onWebLoad(_:url:)`. This method 
    is called when the Screenlet loads the page successfully. How you implement 
    it depends on what (if anything) you want to happen upon page load. Its 
    arguments are the `WebScreenlet` instance and the page URL. This example 
    prints a message to the console indicating that the page was loaded: 

        func onWebLoad(_ screenlet: WebScreenlet, url: String) {
            // Called when the page is loaded
            print("\(url) was just loaded")
        }

3.  Implement the `WebScreenletDelegate` method `screenlet(_:onError:)`. This 
    method is called when an error occurs loading the page, and therefore 
    includes the `NSError` object. This lets you log or print the error. For 
    example, this implementation prints a message containing the error's 
    description: 

        func screenlet(_ screenlet: WebScreenlet, onError error: NSError) {
            print("Failed to load the page: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }

4.  Implement the `WebScreenletDelegate` method 
    `screenlet(_:onScriptMessageNamespace:onScriptMessage:)`. This method is 
    called when 
    [the Screenlet's `WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) 
    sends a message. This method's arguments include the message's namespace and 
    the message. How you implement this method depends on what you want to 
    happen when the message is sent. For example, you could perform a segue and 
    include the message as the segue's `sender`: 

        func screenlet(_ screenlet: WebScreenlet,
            onScriptMessageNamespace namespace: String,
            onScriptMessage message: String) {

            performSegue(withIdentifier: "detail", sender: message)
        }

5.  Get a reference to the Web Screenlet on your storyboard by using Interface 
    Builder to create an outlet to it in your view controller. It's a best 
    practice to name a Screenlet outlet after the Screenlet it references, or 
    simply `screenlet`. Here's an example Web Screenlet outlet: 

        @IBOutlet weak var webScreenlet: WebScreenlet?

6.  In the view controller's `viewDidLoad()` method, use the Web Screenlet 
    reference you just created to set the view controller as the Screenlet's 
    delegate. To do this, add the following line of code just below the 
    `super.viewDidLoad()` call: 

        self.webScreenlet?.delegate = self

Next, you'll use the same Web Screenlet reference to set the Screenlet's 
parameters. 

## Setting Web Screenlet's Parameters [](id=setting-web-screenlets-parameters)

Web Screenlet has `WebScreenletConfiguration` and 
`WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` objects that supply the parameters the 
Screenlet needs to work. These parameters include the URL of the page to load 
and the location of any JavaScript or CSS files that customize the page. You'll 
set most of these parameters via `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder`'s methods.

**Note:** For a full list of `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder`'s methods, and a 
description of each, see the table in 
[the Configuration section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/web-screenlet-for-ios#configuration) 
of Web Screenlet's reference doc. 

$$$

To set Web Screenlet's parameters, follow these steps in the `viewDidLoad()` 
method of a view controller that uses Web Screenlet: 

1.  Use `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder(<url>)`, where `<url>` is the web 
    page's URL string, to create a `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` object. If 
    the page requires @product@ authentication, then the user must be logged in 
    via 
    [Login Screenlet](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/loginscreenlet-for-ios) 
    or a `SessionContext` method, and you must provide a relative URL to the 
    `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` constructor. For example, if such a 
    page's full URL is `http://your.liferay.instance/web/guest/blog`, then the 
    constructor's argument is `/web/guest/blog`. For any other page that doesn't 
    require @product@ authentication, you must supply the full URL to the 
    constructor. 

2.  Call the `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` methods to set the parameters 
    that you need. 

    +$$$

    **Note:** If the URL you supplied to the `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` 
    constructor is to a page that doesn't require @product@ authentication, then 
    you must call the `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` method 
    `set(webType: .other)`. The default `WebType` is `.liferayAuthenticated`, 
    which is required to load @product@ pages that require authentication. If 
    you need to set `.liferayAuthenticated` manually, call 
    `set(webType: .liferayAuthenticated)`. 

    $$$

3.  Call the `WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` instance's `load()` method, 
    which returns a `WebScreenletConfiguration` object. 

4.  Set the `WebScreenletConfiguration` object to the Web Screenlet instance's 
    `configuration` property. 

5.  Call the Web Screenlet instance's `load()` method. 

Here's an example snippet of these steps in the `viewDidLoad()` method of a view 
controller in which the Web Screenlet instance is `webScreenlet`, and the 
`WebScreenletConfiguration` object is `webScreenletConfiguration`: 

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.webScreenlet?.delegate = self

        let webScreenletConfiguration = 
            WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder(url: "/web/westeros-hybrid/companynews")
                .addCss(localFile: "blogs")
                .addJs(localFile: "blogs")
                .load()
        webScreenlet.configuration = webScreenletConfiguration
        webScreenlet.load()
    }

The relative URL `/web/westeros-hybrid/companynews` supplied to the 
`WebScreenletConfigurationBuilder` constructor, and the lack of a 
`set(webType: .other)` call, indicates that this Web Screenlet instance loads a 
@product@ page that requires authentication. The `addCss` and `addJs` calls add 
local CSS and JavaScript files, respectively. Both files are named `blogs`. 

Great! Now you know how to use Web Screenlet in your iOS apps.
