# Using OAuth 2 in Liferay Screens for iOS [](id=using-oauth-2-in-liferay-screens-for-ios)

You can use [OAuth 2](https://oauth.net/2/) 
to authenticate using 
[Login Screenlet](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/loginscreenlet-for-ios) 
with the following 
[OAuth 2 grant types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/): 

-   [**Authorization Code (PKCE for native apps):**](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) 
    Redirects users to a page in their mobile browser where they enter their 
    credentials. Following login, the browser redirects users back to the mobile 
	app. User credentials can't be compromised via the app because it never
	accesses them---it uses a token that can be revoked. This is also useful if
	users don't want to enter their credentials in the app. For example, users
	may not want to enter their Twitter credentials directly in a 3rd-party
	Twitter app, preferring instead to authenticate via Twitter's official
	site. Note that the site you redirect to for authentication must have OAuth
	2 implemented. 

-   [**Resource Owner Password:**](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/) 
    Users authenticate by entering their credentials directly in the app. 

-   [**Client Credentials:**](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/)
    Authenticates without requiring user interaction. This is useful when the 
    app needs to access its own resources, not those of a specific user. 

This tutorial shows you how to use these grant types with Login Screenlet. Note 
that before getting started, you may want to see 
[@product@'s OAuth 2.0 documentation](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/oauth-2-0) 
for instructions on registering an OAuth 2.0 application in the portal. 

## Authorization Code (PKCE) [](id=authorization-code-pkce)

Follow these steps to use the Authorization Code grant type with Login 
Screenlet: 

1.  Configure the URL where the mobile browser redirects after the user 
    authenticates. To do this, follow the first two steps in the 
    [Mobile SDK's Authorization Code instructions](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-oauth-2-in-the-ios-mobile-sdk#authorization-code-pkce). 
    Note that you must configure this URL in both the portal and your iOS app. 

2.  Set Login Screenlet's `loginMode` attribute to `oauth2Redirect`. There are
	two ways to do this: 

    -   In code, as the Login Screenlet instance's `authType` or `loginMode` 
        property:

            loginScreenlet.authType = .oauth2Redirect
            // or
            loginScreenlet.loginMode = "oauth2redirect"

        Note that `oauth2redirect` must be a string when set to `loginMode`. 

    -   In Interface Builder, as the value of the *Login Mode* attribute. Do 
        this the same way you set other Screenlet attributes (via the Attributes 
        inspector, with the Screenlet selected in the storyboard). Be sure to 
        enter `oauth2redirect` with no period preceding it. 

3.  Set Login Screenlet's `oauth2clientId` attribute to the ID of the portal's 
    OAuth 2 application that you want to use. To find this value, navigate to 
    that application in the portal's OAuth 2 Admin portlet. 

4.  Set Login Screenlet's `oauth2redirectUrl` attribute to the URL you 
    configured in step 1. 

5.  In your `AppDelegate`'s `application(_:open:options:)` method, call the 
    `SessionContext` method `oauth2ResumeAuthorization` with the URL. This 
    notifies Liferay Screens when the redirect has been performed. For more 
    information on the `application(_:open:options:)` method, see the section 
    *Handle Incoming URLs* in 
    [Apple's documentation on using custom URLs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/communicating_with_other_apps_using_custom_urls): 

        func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, 
            options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
                return SessionContext.oauth2ResumeAuthorization(url: url)
        }

Note that you can cancel the authorization at any time by calling 
`SessionContext.oauth2Cancel()`. 

## Resource Owner Password [](id=resource-owner-password)

Follow these steps to use the Resource Owner Password grant type with Login 
Screenlet: 

1.  Set Login Screenlet's `loginMode` attribute to `oauth2UsernameAndPassword`.
	There are two ways to do this: 

    -   In code, as the Login Screenlet instance's `authType` or `loginMode` 
        property:

            loginScreenlet.authType = .oauth2UsernameAndPassword
            // or
            loginScreenlet.loginMode = "oauth2UsernameAndPassword"

        Note that `oauth2UsernameAndPassword` must be a string when setting 
        `loginMode`. 

    -   In Interface Builder, as the value of the *Login Mode* attribute. Do 
        this the same way you set other Screenlet attributes (via the Attributes 
        inspector, with the Screenlet selected in the storyboard). Be sure to 
        enter `oauth2UsernameAndPassword` with no period preceding it. 

2.  Set Login Screenlet's `oauth2clientId` attribute to the ID of the OAuth
	2 application that you want to use. To find this value, navigate to that
	application in the OAuth 2 Admin portlet. 

3.  Set Login Screenlet's `oauth2clientSecret` attribute to the same OAuth 2 
    application's client secret. 

## Client Credentials [](id=client-credentials)

The OAuth 2 Client Credentials grant type authenticates without requiring user 
interaction. This is useful when the app needs to access its own resources, not 
those of a specific user. 

+$$$

**Warning:** The Client Credentials grant type poses a security risk to the 
portal. To authenticate without user credentials, the mobile app must contain 
the OAuth 2 application's client ID and client secret. Anyone who can access 
those values via the mobile app can also authenticate without user credentials. 

$$$

Follow these steps to use the Client Credentials grant type in your Screens app: 

1.  Follow the 
    [iOS Mobile SDK instructions](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-oauth-2-in-the-ios-mobile-sdk#client-credentials) 
    for using the Client Credentials grant type. 

2.  The session object's `authentication` property contains a valid 
    authentication object. Cast it to `LROAuth2Authentication` then pass it to 
    the `authentication` argument of the `SessionContext` method 
    `loginWithOAuth2`: 

        let auth = session.authentication as! LROAuth2Authentication

        SessionContext.loginWithOAuth2(authentication: auth, userAttributes: [:])

    This initializes the Screens `SessionContext` object, authenticating any 
    Screenlets that you use in the iOS app.
