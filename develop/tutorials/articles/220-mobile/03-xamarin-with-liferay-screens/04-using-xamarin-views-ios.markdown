# Using Themes in Xamarin.iOS [](id=using-themes-in-xamarin-ios)

*Themes* in Xamarin.iOS are analogous to *Views* in Xamarin.Android. Like Views, 
Themes let you set a Screenlet's look and feel independent of the Screenlet's 
core functionality. Liferay's Screenlets come with several Themes, and more are 
being developed by Liferay and the community. 
[The Screenlet reference documentation](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/screenlets-in-liferay-screens-for-ios) 
lists the Themes available for each Screenlet included with Screens. This 
tutorial shows you how to use Themes in Xamarin.iOS. 

## Installing and Using Themes [](id=installing-and-using-themes)

Follow these steps to install and use a Theme: 

1.  If the Theme is packaged as a NuGet dependency, you can install it in your 
    project via NuGet. To do so, right-click your project's *Packages* folder 
    and then select *Add packages...*. Then search for the Theme and install it. 
    If the Theme isn't available in NuGet, you can drag and drop the Theme's 
    folder directly into your project. 

2.  To use the installed Theme, set its name to the Screenlet instance's 
    `ThemeName` property in your view controller that implements the Screenlet's 
    delegate. All Screenlets inherit this property from 
    `BaseScreenlet`. For example, this code sets Login Screenlet's `ThemeName` 
    property to the Material Theme: 

        loginScreenlet.ThemeName = "material"

    If you don't set this property or enter an invalid or missing Theme, the 
    Screenlet uses its Default Theme. Each Screenlet's available Themes are 
    listed in the *Themes* section of the Screenlet's 
    [reference documentation](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/screenlets-in-liferay-screens-for-ios). 

Great, that's it! Now you know how to use Themes to dress up Screenlets in your 
Xamarin.iOS apps.
