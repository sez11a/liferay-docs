#Why Liferay's Platform is Good for Developers
This Learning Path will guide you through the process of creating a Web Application using @product@ and Liferay's development toolset. First we'll talk about Liferay's key features for developers, then we'll go through the steps for setting up a Liferay development environment using @ide@, after than we'll create a basically application, and finally we'll go through each aspect of a Liferay application that you might need for creating a full-featured web application. 

##Modularity
One of the key features of @product@ for developers is modularity. Liferay 7.0 uses OSGi to provide a framework for modular development. Developing modularly provides many benefits. Updating your code base is easier when you only need to consider one aspect of the application at a time. Dependencies can be more easily swapped in and out. Class loader issues are eliminated by deploying inside of the OSGi container. If you aren't sold yet on OSGi and Modularity, you can find more information in our [OSGI and Modularity for Liferay Portal 6 Developers](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers) article.

##Using Liferay's Features
When you create an application with Liferay, you gain the ability to connect it with the every different facet of Liferay's core applications and capabilities. You can integrate features like Liferay's built-in rich text editor or manage files for the application with Documents and Media. You can also use tools Liferay's Permissions system and services like Kaleo Workflow and Staging to take advantage of Liferay's enterprise frameworks. To learn more about the full depth of Liferay's development features, see [Introduction to Liferay Development](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-liferay-development)

##Service Builder
Service Builder is a code generation tool to automatically generate code for database management. With Service Builder, you define all of your entities using an XML file, and all of your Create, Read, Update, and Delete code is generated for you. You can then integrate those methods into your application. Service Builder is designed to save you time and provide standardized code for all database interaction.

##Liferay Development Tools
The easiest way to integrate all of these features is to use the development tools that Liferay provides - @ide@ and BLADE Tools for the command line. @ide@ provides an integrated development environment based on Eclipse to help you more quickly and easily develop using Liferay's development framework and to integrate with all of the great features that we've been talking about.
