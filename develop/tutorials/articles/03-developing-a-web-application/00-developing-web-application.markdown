#Developing a Web Application

In this Learning Path, we show you the steps to create a Liferay Web Application from scratch using tools like @ide@ and BLADE tools. The application we create uses all of the best practices and standards for @product@, and completing this Learning Path will prepare you to write your own web applications that meet your needs or the needs of your organization.

To develop a web application with Liferay, we start at the beginning: setting up a Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text editor and the command line to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay provides @ide@ to make it easier to write code on Liferay’s platform, and integrates Liferay's BLADE tools for modular development.

Once you have a development environment setup, we move on to the main aspects of developing an application. From modeling data to Service Builder, we cover everything you need to know to create and run your base application.

From there we'll cover everything from UI standards to providing remote services. Once we have everything completed and wrapped up with a bow, we distribute the application on Marketplace.

Note: To follow Liferay’s learning paths, you must have a @product@ instance installed. You must also have the Java 8 JDK installed.
