# Implementing Permission Checks [](id=implementing-permission-checks)

Now that your guestbook and guestbook entry web services are up and running, 
it's time to implement permission checks for them. Implementing permission
checks for a web service ensures that only users with the correct permissions
can invoke the web service. To implement permission checks in your remote
services, you'll use the `GuestbookModelPermission`, `GuestbookPermission`, and
`EntryPermission` helper classes that you created in an earlier section of the
Learning Path. These classes provide helper methods for checking permissions.
The helper methods in `GuestbookModelPermission` are for checking top level
model permissions. For example, if you need to check whether a user has
permission to add a new guestbook or guestbook entry, you can use
`GuestbookModelPermission`'s helper methods. If, on the other hand, you need to
check whether a user has permission to update or delete an existing guestbook
or guestbook entry, you can use `GuestbookPermission` or `EntryPermission`.


Once you've secured your remote services with permission checks, you'll update
your portlet classes so that they call the remote services instead of the local
services. This prevents attackers from trying to bypass your app's UI by
playing with URL parameters to access sensitive portions of your app.
