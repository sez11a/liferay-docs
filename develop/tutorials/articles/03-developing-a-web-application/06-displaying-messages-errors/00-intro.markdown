# Displaying Messages and Errors

When creating an application, you often need to communicate with users outside 
of the bounds of the User Interface. You want to display useful error messages 
and also confirmation messages for users when they interact with the 
application. When a user takes an action, you confirm that the action was 
successful. If the action fails, you provide a useful error message letting the
user know what went wrong. Previously, you left some placeholder code for error
messages. Now go back through them and add the appropriate messaging for users.
