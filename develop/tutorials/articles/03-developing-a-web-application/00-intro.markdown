# Developing a Web Application

In this Learning Path, you'll go through the steps to create the Guestbook 
Liferay Web Application from scratch using tools like @ide@ and BLADE tools. As 
you create the Guestbook, you'll learn how to create back-end database, web 
services, a security model, UI, and more using all of the best practices and 
standards for @product@. Completing this Learning Path will prepare you to 
write your own app and further explore Liferay's APIs 

To develop a web application with Liferay, start at the beginning: setting 
up a Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text 
editor and the command line to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay provides @ide@ 
to make it easier to write code on Liferayâ€™s platform, and integrates Liferay's 
BLADE tools for modular development. 

Once you have a development environment setup, you can move on to the main 
aspects of developing an application. From modeling data to Service Builder, 
this covers everything you need to know to create and run your base 
application. 

From there you'll see everything from UI standards to providing remote 
services. Once everything is completed and wrapped up with a bow, you can 
distribute the application on Marketplace.
