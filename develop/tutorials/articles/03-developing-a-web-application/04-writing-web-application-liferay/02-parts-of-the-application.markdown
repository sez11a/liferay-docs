#Parts of the Application
This would probably be a good place for an overview of MVC stuff and action command stuff and all that?

##MVC Portlet
The base of the application is the MVC Portlet pattern, but it goes beyond that

##ActionCommand
We use various "action" classes to handle much of our stuff that we do in the JSPs and stuff.

##Look at this App, that I just found
It's important that we actually be able to enjoying looking at and using the app as well, which is why we have standards for that sort of thing. JSPs handle this part.

##The Backend
This app has a big backend.
