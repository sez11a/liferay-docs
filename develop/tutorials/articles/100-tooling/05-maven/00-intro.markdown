# Maven [](id=maven)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a viable option for managing Liferay
projects if you don't want to use Liferay's default Gradle management system.
Liferay provides several Maven plugins to let you generate your project and
manage it with ease. Liferay also provides Maven artifacts, which are easy to
obtain and are required for Liferay Maven module development. In the Maven
tutorials, you'll learn how to

- Install Liferay Maven artifacts.

<!--
- Generate Liferay Maven projects using archetypes.
- Create a Module JAR.
- Deploy a Maven project to @product@.
-->

- Manage Liferay Maven projects.
- Deploy a Liferay Maven project to a remote repository.

<!--
- Use Service Builder in a Liferay Maven project.
- Compile Sass files with Maven.
-->

Because Liferay is tool agnostic, Maven is fully supported for Liferay Maven
module development. Read on to learn more!
