# Deploying a Module Built with Maven to @product@

Deploying a Liferay module built with Maven can be completed two ways:

- Manually copy your generated Maven module JAR to your @product@ instance's
  `/deploy` folder.
- Configure your Maven project to deploy to the @product@ instance automatically
  by running a Maven command via the command prompt.

Although manually copying your module JAR for deployment is a viable option,
this is an inefficient way to deploy your projects. With just a few simple
configurations in your Maven POMs, you can deploy a module to @product@ with one
command execution.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy your Liferay module built with
Maven automatically. Before you can deploy it, you must have it configured to
generate an OSGi module JAR; visit the
[Creating a Module JAR Using Maven](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-module-jar-using-maven)
tutorial for more information.

You'll learn how to deploy your Liferay module automatically next.

1.  Add the following `maven-antrun-plugin` configuration to your Liferay Maven
    project's parent `pom.xml` file.

        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>1.7</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <id>deploy-liferay-artifacts</id>
                            <phase>pre-integration-test</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>run</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <target name="maven-deploy">
                                    <copy failonerror="false" file="${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.war" quiet="true" tofile="${deploy.dir}/${project.artifactId}.war"/>
                                    <copy failonerror="false" file="${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar" quiet="true" tofile="${deploy.dir}/${project.artifactId}.jar"/>
                                </target>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>

    This POM configuration applies the
    [Maven AntRun Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin/)
    by defining its `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`. The logic also
    defines

    - The
      [`executions` tag](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html#Using_the_executions_Tag),
      which configures the Maven AntRun plugin to run during the
      `pre-integration-test` phase of your Maven project's build lifecycle. The
      `run`
      [goal](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#A_Build_Phase_is_Made_Up_of_Plugin_Goals)
      is defined for that lifecycle phase.
    - The
      [`configuration` tag](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugins), which
      configures and runs an Ant target from the POM. The logic above creates a
      `build-maven-deploy.xml` file in your project's build folder (e.g.,
      `/target`) containing the Ant target specified. That file is then
      executed, which copies any JAR or WAR file from your Maven project's build
      folder to your @product@ instance's deployment folder. You'll configure
      the deployment folder next.

2.  Add the following `properties` tag outside the `build` tag in your project's
    parent `pom.xml` file:

        <properties>
            <deploy.dir>${liferay-bundle}/deploy</deploy.dir>
        </properties>

    This logic configures your deployment directory. Make sure to replace the
    `${liferay-bundle}` variable with your @product@ instance's file path.

3.  To invoke the Maven AntRun plugin from your project, configure it in your
    project's `pom.xml`:

        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
               </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>

4.  Navigate to your Maven project in a command prompt and deploy your project
    to the configured deployment folder:

        mvn verify

That's it! Your Liferay Maven project is automatically copied to your @product@
instance's deployment folder and ready for use.
