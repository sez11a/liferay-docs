# Installing Liferay Workspace [](id=installing-liferay-workspace)

Liferay Workspace can be installed to your machine using the Liferay Workspace

[Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli) into your user
home folder, and optionally initializes a Liferay Workspace folder. This is the
same installer used to install Blade CLI, which is covered in the
[Installing Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli)
tutorial.
