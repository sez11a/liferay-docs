# Modifying the Target Platform's Capabilities

In a perfect world, everything the `resolve` task gathers and checks against
would work during your development process. Unfortunately, there are exceptions
that may force you to modify the default functionality of the `resolve` task. If
you're unfamiliar with workspace's `resolve` task, see the
[Resolving Your Modules](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/resolving-your-modules)
tutorial for more information.

There are two scenarios you may run into during development that require a
modification for your project to pass the resolver check.

- You're depending on a third party library that is not available in the
  targeted @product@ instance or the current workspace.
- You're depending on a customized distribution of @product@.

You'll explore these use cases next.

## Depending on Third Party Libraries Not Included in @product@

The `resolve` task, by default, gathers all of @product@'s capabilities and the
capabilities of your workspace's modules. What if, however, your module depends
on a third party project that is not included in either space (e.g.,
[Google Guava](https://opensource.google.com/projects/guava))?. The `resolve`
task fails by default if your project depends on this project type. You
probably plan to have this project deployed and available in @product@ at
runtime, so it's not a concern, but the resolver doesn't know that; you'll need
to customize the resolver to bypass this.

There are three ways you can do this:

- [Embed the third party library in your module](#embed-the-third-party-project-in-your-module)
- [Add the third party library's capabilities to the current static set of resolver capabilities](#add-the-third-party-librarys-capabilities-to-the-current-static-set-of-resolver-capabilities)
- [Skip the resolving process for your module](#skip-the-resolving-process-for-your-module)

For help resolving third party dependency errors, see the
[Resolving Third Party Library Package Dependencies](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module)
tutorial.

### Embed the Third Party Library in Your Module

If you only have one module that depends on the third party project, you can
bypass the resolver failure by embedding the JAR in your module. This is not
best practice if more than one project in your @product@ instance depends on
that module. See the
[Embedding Libraries in a Module](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module#embedding-libraries-in-a-module)
section for more details.

### Add the Third Party Library's Capabilities to the Current Static Set of Resolver Capabilities

You can add your third party dependencies to the target platform's default list
of capabilities by listing them as provided modules. Do this by adding the
following Gradle code into your workspace's root `build.gradle` file:

    dependencies {
        providedModules group: "GROUP_ID", name: "NAME", version: "VERSION"
    }

For example, if you wanted to provide
[Google Guava](https://opensource.google.com/projects/guava) as a provided
module, it would look like this:

    dependencies {
        providedModules group: "com.google.guava", name: "guava", version: "23.0"
    }

Not only does this provide the third party dependency to the resolver, it also
downloads and includes it in your @product@ bundle's `osgi/modules` folder when
you initialize it (e.g., `gradlew initBundle`).

### Skip the Resolving Process for Your Module

It may be easiest to skip validating a particular module during the resolve
process. To do this, open your workspace's root `build.gradle` file and insert
the following Gradle code at the bottom of the file:

    targetPlatform {
        resolveOnlyIf { project ->
            project.name != 'PROJECT_NAME'
        }
    }

Be sure to replace the `PROJECT_NAME` filler with your module's name (e.g.,
`test-api`).

If you prefer to disable the Target Platform plugin all together, you can add a
slightly different directive to your `build.gradle` file:

    targetPlatform {
        onlyIf { project ->
            project.name != 'PROJECT_NAME'
        }
    }

This not only skips the `resolve` task execution, it also disables BOM
dependency management. 

Now the `resolve` task skips your module project.

## Depending on a Customized Distribution of @product@

There are times when manually specifying your project's list of dependent JARs
does not suffice. If your app requires a customized @product@ instance to
properly run, you must regenerate the target platform's default list of
capabilities with an updated list. Two examples of a customized @product@
instance are described below:

**Example 1: Leveraging an External Feature**

There are many external features/frameworks available for @product@ that are not
included in the downloadable bundle by default. Once deploying a
feature/framework to @product@, it's available for your module projects to
leverage. When validating your app, however, the `resolve` task does not have
access to external capabilities not included by default. For example, Audience
Targeting is an example of this type of external framework. If you're creating a
Liferay Audience Targeting rule that depends on the Audience Targeting
framework, you can't easily provide a slew of JARs for your module. In this
case, you should install the platform you wish to depend on and regenerate an
updated list of capabilities that your @product@ instance will provide.

**Example 2: Leveraging a Customized Core Feature**

You can easily extend @product@'s core features to provide a customized
experience for your intended audience. When core features are customized, you'll
develop your app to assume these customizations are present when it's deployed.
The new capabilities resulting from your customizations are not available in the
target platform's default list of capabilities. Therefore, when your application
relies on these capabilities that are not available by default, it fails during
the `resolve` task. To get around this, you must regenerate a new  list of
capabilities that your customized @product@ instance will provide.

To regenerate the target platform's capabilities (distro JAR) based on the
current workspace's @product@ instance, follow the steps below:

<!-- The below process will likely be automated in Blade at some point. -Cody -->

1.  Start the @product@ instance stored in your workspace. Make sure the
    platform you want to depend on is installed.

2.  Download the
    [BND Remote Agent JAR file](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cbiz.aqute.remote.agent)
    and copy it into your @product@ instance's `osgi/modules` folder.

3.  From the root folder of you workspace, run the following command:

        bnd remote distro -o custom_distro.jar com.liferay.ce.portal.distro 7.1.0

    This connects to the newly deployed BND agent running in @product@ and
    generates a new distro JAR named `custom_distro.jar`. All other capabilities
    will be overridden based on the @product@ instance you're generating the
    custom distro against, so verify the workspace bundle is the version you
    plan to release for in production.

4.  Navigate to your workspace's root `build.gradle` file and add the following
    dependency:

        dependencies {
            targetPlatformDistro files('custom_distro.jar')
        }

Now your workspace is pointing to a custom distro JAR file instead of the
default one provided. Run the `resolve` task to validate your custom modules
against the custom set of capabilities.
