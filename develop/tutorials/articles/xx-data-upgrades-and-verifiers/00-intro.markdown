# Data Upgrades and Verifiers [](id=data-upgrades-and-verifiers)

Your app goes through various stages of development. You add new features,
remove features, improve features, reorganize the code, etc. During the cycle of
development, you'll want to upgrade your app to a new version to indicate to
your end users that improvements have been made. Liferay provides a robust 
upgrade framework for you to use. In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how 
to create an upgrade process for your application, and how to migrate your 
existing upgrade processes to use the new upgrade framework.
