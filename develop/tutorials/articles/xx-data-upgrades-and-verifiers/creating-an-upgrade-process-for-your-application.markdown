# Creating An Upgrade Process for Your App [](id=creating-an-upgrade-process-for-your-app)

As changes are made to your app, it is important that you upgrade your schema
version. To move your app from one version to the next, you'll need to create an 
upgrade process. These upgrades need to be registered in the database. The 
system then records the current state of the schema so, in case of failure, 
upgrade processes can revert the app back to its previous version.

This tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Create an upgrade process for your app using Liferay's new upgrade framework
- Migrate an existing upgrade process to the new upgrade framework

Go ahead and jump right in to declaring your dependencies next.

## Declaring Your Dependencies [](id=declaring-your-dependencies)

If your app has any dependencies, you'll have to declare a dependency on the
`portal-upgrade` module in your `build.gradle` file:

    compile project(":portal:portal-upgrade")

Now that your dependencies are declared, you can write your upgrade package
next.

## Writing the Upgrade Package [](id=writing-the-upgrade-package)

The first thing you need to do is create a package called `upgrade` in your 
project’s layout. Inside of the `upgrade` package, create a OSGi Component of 
the service `UpgradeStepRegistrator` that implements the interface 
`UpgradeStepRegistrator`, which is located under the [portal-upgrade module](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/modules/portal/portal-upgrade&sa=D&ust=1464278927768000&usg=AFQjCNGF0wzU7e50p5GOwiXbT7XQ1OJ1JQ)).

This interface provides a `register` method that handles the upgrade 
registration process.

    @Component(immediate = true, service = UpgradeStepRegistrator.class)
    public class CalendarServiceUpgrade implements UpgradeStepRegistrator {
    
    	@Override
    	public void register(Registry registry) {
    	
    	}
    }

Once you've implemented your `UpgradeStepRegister` interface, you’ll have to use 
its `register` method to specify your upgrades, defining from which versions you 
want to upgrade, to the version it will be upgraded to.

Each upgrade is represented by an upgrade registration. An Upgrade registration 
is an abstraction for the changes you need to apply to the database from one 
version to the next one.

To define a registration, you need to provide:
- the bundle symbolic name of the module.
- the schema version your module wants to upgrade from (as a String)
- the schema version your module wants to upgrade to (as a String)
- a list of UpgradeSteps

For example, here is an upgrade process for the `com.liferay.calendar.service`
module:

    @Override

    public void register(Registry registry) {
    
    	registry.register(
        		"com.liferay.calendar.service", "0.0.1", "1.0.0",
        		new com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_0.UpgradeCalendarBooking()));    
    }

In this example, the `com.liferay.calendar.service` module is being upgraded 
from version 0.0.1 to version 1.0.0. The changes are produced by a list of 
UpgradeSteps, which in this example contains only one step:

    new com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_0.UpgradeCalendarBooking());
    
You can also register multiple upgrades in one class. For example, here is an
extension of the previous upgrade process that runs two additional upgrades, 
each with their own set of UpgradeSteps:

    @Override
    public void register(Registry registry) {
        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "0.0.1", "1.0.0",
            new com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_0.UpgradeCalendarBooking());

        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "1.0.0", "1.0.1",
            new com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_1.UpgradeCalendarBooking());

        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "1.0.1", "1.0.2",
            new UpgradeCalendar());

        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "1.0.2", "1.0.3",
            new DummyUpgradeStep());

        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "1.0.3", "1.0.4",
            new UpgradeClassNames());

        registry.register(
            "com.liferay.calendar.service", "1.0.4", "1.0.5",
            new UpgradeCalendarResource(
                _classNameLocalService, _companyLocalService,
                _userLocalService),
            new UpgradeCompanyId(), new UpgradeLastPublishDate());
    }

In this example the `com.liferay.calendar.service` module is upgraded from 
version 0.01 to 1.0.0 with one step. Next it is upgraded incrementally from 
version 1.0.1 to 1.0.4, using only one UpgradeStep for each schema version. 
Finally, it is upgraded from version 1.0.4 to version 1.0.5, using a list of 
UpgradeSteps with three steps in it: `UpgradeCalendarResource`, 
`UpgradeCompanyId` and `UpgradeLastPublishDate`.

+$$$

**Note:** Be careful with upgrade steps with the same name in different packages. 
This could result in the wrong version being used for the upgrade.
(see com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_0.UpgradeCalendarBooking 
and com.liferay.calendar.upgrade.v1_0_1.UpgradeCalendarBooking as example).

$$$

The upgrade process shown previously results in the creation of three rows in 
the Release table, one per upgrade registration. In terms of data, each 
registration is represented by a row in the `Release_ table` on portal’s 
database. You can check the database to verify which upgrades have been executed 
for each module.

Next, you can learn how to specify differing module versions and schema versions
in your bundle.

## Specifying Schema Versions [](id=specifying-schema-versions)

If your database schema is a different version than your module version, you can 
specify it in the BND file. Add the `Require-SchemaVersion` property to your 
`bnd.bnd` file to describe that the schema version of the module uses a 
different version than the bundle version:

    Require-SchemaVersion: 1.0.2

That's all you need to do to create an upgrade process for your app. Read the
next section to learn how to migrate an existing upgrade process to the new
framework.

## Migrating an existing upgrade process to the new framework [](id=migrating-an-existing-upgrade-process-to-the-new-framework)

Migrating your older code to use the new framework is the same process covered 
in the previous section, with a few additions. Before you get started, you can 
review the older upgrade process next.

### Previous Upgrade Process Review [](id=previous-upgrade-process-review)

Following the prior upgrade process, you have to define the property 
upgrade.processes, a list of UpgradeProcesses representing the different 
upgrades for a specific version of your module.

For instance, the code below shows the prior upgrade process for 
Calendar-service module from v1.0.0 to 1.0.1, and then to 1.0.2. :

upgrade.processes=\
    com.liferay.calendar.hook.upgrade.UpgradeProcess_1_0_0,\
    com.liferay.calendar.hook.upgrade.UpgradeProcess_1_0_1,\
    com.liferay.calendar.hook.upgrade.UpgradeProcess_1_0_2

Each step between versions was represented by a single class extending
UpgradeProcess, with a method `doUpgrade`. This method was responsible for
executing the internal steps to update the database to that concrete
version. A method `getThreadhold` is provided also to specify the schema 
version where the upgrade starts.

The following example represents the required operations to update the database 
to v1.0.0. using the old framework:

    public class UpgradeProcess_1_0_0 extends UpgradeProcess {
    
        @Override
        public int getThreshold() {
            return 100;
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void doUpgrade() throws Exception {
            upgrade(UpgradeCalendarBooking.class);
        }
        
    }

The following example represents the required operations to update the database 
to v1.0.1. using the old framework:

    public class UpgradeProcess_1_0_1 extends UpgradeProcess {
    
        @Override
        public int getThreshold() {
            return 101;
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void doUpgrade() throws Exception {
            upgrade(UpgradeCalendar.class);
            upgrade(UpgradeCalendarBooking.class);
        }
        
    }


The following example represents the required operations to update the database 
to v1.0.2. using the old framework:

    public class UpgradeProcess_1_0_1 extends UpgradeProcess {
    
        @Override
        public int getThreshold() {
            return 102;
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void doUpgrade() throws Exception {
             upgrade(UpgradePortletPreferences.class);
        }
        
    }

Whenever you needed another internal step, you added another 
`upgrade(new UpgradePortletPreferences());` etc. after the existing ones.

Now that you are familiarized with the older framework, you can learn how to
migrate your code to the new upgrade framework next.

### Migrating Your Code to the New Framework [](id=migrating-your-code-to-the-new-framework)

You can review the [Creating An Upgrade Process for Your Application](#creating-an-upgrade-process-for-your-app) 
sections for more detailed instructions and examples. Follow the steps below to
migrate your code to the new framework.

1.  Update your build files.

    Add a dependency on the `portal-upgrade` module to your `build.gradle` file. 

2.  Check your database schema version against your bundle version.

    If the database schema is in a different version than the bundle version, 
    specify the different versions for the bundle and schema in your `bnd.bnd` 
    file, using the `require-SchemaVersion` property:

        require-SchemaVersion: 1.0.2

    If no `Required-SchemaVersion` is found, the `Bundle-Version` header will be 
    used. Now that the build files are configured, you can move on to the 
    upgrade class next.

3.  Update the upgrade class to implement the `UpgradeStepRegistrator` interface.

4.  Remove the intermediate classes that wrapped the internal steps, i.e the 
    `UpgradeProcess_1_0_0.java`.

    With the new framework, previous type of classes will be represented by the 
    upgrade registration explained in the [Writing the Upgrade Package](#writing-the-upgrade-package) 
    section.

    The internal steps defined within the intermediate classes, the former 
    `UpgradeProcess` class, as they are indeed UpgradeSteps, require no change
    on your part. The new framework will process the steps as they are.

5.  Remove the logger code:

    private static final Log _log = logFactoryUtil.getLog(
        UpgradeProcess_1_0_0.class);

6.  Use the `@Reference` annotation described in the [Initializing Your Module](#initializing-your-module)
    section, to reference the services that you need for the upgrade. 

    @Reference(unbind = "-")
    protected void setClassNameLocalService(
        ClassNameLocalService classNameLocalService) {
    
    @Reference(unbind = "-")
            protected void setClassNameLocalService(
                ClassNameLocalService classNameLocalService) {
          
                _	_classNameLocalService = classNameLocalService;
    }
    
    @Reference(unbind = "-")
    protected void setCompanyLocalService(
        CompanyLocalService companyLocalService) {
    
        _companyLocalService = companyLocalService;
    }
    
    @Reference(unbind = "-")
    protected void setUserLocalService(UserLocalService userLocalService) {
        _userLocalService = userLocalService;
    }

A summary of the steps for migration are outlined in the table below for
