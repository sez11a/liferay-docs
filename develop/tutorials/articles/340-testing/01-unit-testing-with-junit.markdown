# Unit Testing with JUnit [](id=unit-testing-with-junit)

Test driven development is a best practice for any developer. Unit tests verify
and validate functionality of classes and methods in isolation by "mocking" 
external dependencies. One of the most widely-used tools for test driven
development on the Java platform is [JUnit](https://www.junit.org). 

JUnit integrates with Maven and Gradle build environments, including

and
[Liferay Maven Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/maven-workspace). 
JUnit plugins are available in IDEs such as

Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans.
