# Testing [](id=testing)

Assuring top quality is paramount in producing awesome software. Test driven
development plays a key role in this process. Liferay's tooling and integration
with standard test frameworks support test driven development and help you
reach quality milestones. Here are the ways Liferay facilitates testing:

- [Unit testing](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/unit-testing-with-junit):
  JUnit runs test cases @product@ modules in Gradle and Maven build environments
  and in IDEs.
- [Injecting Service Components into Tests](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/injecting-service-components-into-tests): 
    Liferay's `@Inject` annotation injects service instances into
    tests. 

Unit testing is the first step in test driven development.
