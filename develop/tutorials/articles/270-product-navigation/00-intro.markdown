# Product Navigation [](id=product-navigation)

Liferay's product navigation consists of the main menus you use to customize,
configure, and navigate your Liferay instance. When you edit a page, switch
to a different site scope, access a user's credentials, etc., you're using the 
default navigation menus. Liferay's product navigation is intuitive and 
extensive, but providing a customization to a default menu can help give your 
Liferay instance a unique touch. Liferay allows developers to extend and 
customize the default product navigation to fit their needs.

There are four main sections of Liferay's product navigation that you can
extend: Product Menu, Control Menu, Simulation Menu, and User Personal Menu.

The Product Menu is the menu to the left that displays your's instance's 
Control Panel, user account settings, and Site Administration functionality. 
The Control Menu is the top menu offering navigation to the Product Menu, 
Simulation Menu (the right menu), and *Add* button. When certain settings are 
enabled (e.g., Staging, Page Customization, etc.) more tools are offered. The 
Simulation Menu offers options to simulate your site's look for different scenarios (devices, user segments, etc.). Lastly, the User Peronsal Menu is used to hold selectable items that aid with a user's own account settings.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn about the various ways you can extend
and customize Liferay's product navigation to fit your needs.
