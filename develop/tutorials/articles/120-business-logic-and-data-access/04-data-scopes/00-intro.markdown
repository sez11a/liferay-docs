# Data Scopes [](id=data-scopes)

Apps in @product@ can restrict their data to specific 
[scopes](https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/scope). 
For example, a site-scoped app can display its data across a single site. For a 
detailed explanation of scopes, see the user guide article 
[Application Scope](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/application-scope). 
Scoping, however, isn't available by default for custom apps. You have to 
manually add support for it. This tutorial shows you how. 

## Scoping Your Entities [](id=scoping-your-entities)

In your service layer, your entities must have a `companyId` attribute of type 
`long` to enable scoping by portal instance, and a `groupId` attribute of type 
`long` to enable scoping by site. Using 
[Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/what-is-service-builder) 
is the simplest way to do this. For instructions on this, see the tutorial 
series 
[Service Builder Persistence](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/service-builder-persistence) 
and 
[Business Logic with Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/business-logic-with-service-builder). 

## Enabling Scoping [](id=enabling-scoping)

To enable scoping in your app, set the property 
`"com.liferay.portlet.scopeable=true"` in your portlet class's `@Component` 
annotation. For example, this property is set to `true` in the `@Component` 
annotation of 
[Web Content Display Portlet's portlet class](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.x/modules/apps/web-experience/journal/journal-content-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/journal/content/web/internal/portlet/JournalContentPortlet.java): 

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        property = {
            ...
            "com.liferay.portlet.scopeable=true",
            ...,
        },
        service = Portlet.class
    )
    public class JournalContentPortlet extends MVCPortlet {...

That's it! You can now access your app's scope in your code. The next section 
shows you how. 

## Accessing Your App's Scope [](id=accessing-your-apps-scope)

Your app's current `groupId` is the `groupId` of the site the user places your 
app on. This is the value you'll most commonly need when working with your app's 
scope. Therefore, the following techniques focus on this. You can use similar 
techniques to access the `companyId`. These are noted where applicable. 

Your app's scope is available: 

1. Via the `scopeGroupId` variable that is injected in your JSPs whenever you 
   use the `<liferay-theme:defineObjects />` tag. For example, Liferay's 
   Bookmarks app uses `scopeGroupId` in 
   [its `view.jsp`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.x/modules/apps/collaboration/bookmarks/bookmarks-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/bookmarks/view.jsp) 
   to retrieve the current site's bookmarks and total number of bookmarks: 

        ...
        total = BookmarksEntryServiceUtil.getGroupEntriesCount(scopeGroupId, groupEntriesUserId);
        
        bookmarksSearchContainer.setTotal(total);
        bookmarksSearchContainer.setResults(BookmarksEntryServiceUtil.getGroupEntries(scopeGroupId, groupEntriesUserId, bookmarksSearchContainer.getStart(), bookmarksSearchContainer.getEnd()));
        ...

2. By calling the `getScopeGroupId()` method on the request's 
   [`ThemeDisplay` instance](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0-ga3/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/theme/ThemeDisplay.html). 
   For example, the 
   [`EditEntryMVCActionCommand` class](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.x/modules/apps/collaboration/blogs/blogs-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/blogs/web/internal/portlet/action/EditEntryMVCActionCommand.java) 
   in Liferay's Blogs app does this in its `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` 
   methods: 

        protected void subscribe(ActionRequest actionRequest) throws Exception {
            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)actionRequest.getAttribute(
                WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);

            _blogsEntryService.subscribe(themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId());
        }

        protected void unsubscribe(ActionRequest actionRequest) throws Exception {
            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)actionRequest.getAttribute(
                WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);

            _blogsEntryService.unsubscribe(themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId());
        }

    If you need the portal instance ID, use `themeDisplay.getCompanyId()`. If 
    your app is scoped to a page, use `themeDisplay.getSiteGroupId()` to get the 
    parent site's `groupId`. 

3. By calling the `getScopeGroupId()` method on a `ServiceContext` object. You 
   can find more information on this, and an example, in the tutorial 
   [Understanding `ServiceContext`](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/understanding-servicecontext). 
   If you need the portal instance ID, use the `getCompanyId()` method on a 
   `ServiceContext` object. 

Great! Now you know how to scope your apps.
