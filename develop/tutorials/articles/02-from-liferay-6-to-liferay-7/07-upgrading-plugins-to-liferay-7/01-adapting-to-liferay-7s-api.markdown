# Adapting to @product-full@ 7's API with the Code Upgrade Tool [](id=adapting-to-liferay-7s-api-with-the-code-upgrade-tool)

The first upgrade process step is to adapt your existing plugin's code to
@product-full@ 7's API. @product-full@ 7 is a major release that contains significant API
changes. As part of the modularization process, many packages have been renamed
to adopt a new standard. But each API change has been carefully documented to
explain what changed, how to adapt to the change, and why the change was made.

To go above and beyond documenting the changes, there's the Code Upgrade
Tool: a tool that knows about these changes, analyzes your code, and suggests
how to adapt the code to the new APIs.

The Liferay Code Upgrade Tool (initially called the Migration Tool) is in
Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio. You should use the tool to adapt code
to @product-full@ 7; you can switch back to your favorite tool afterwards.

This tutorial shows you how to adapt existing plugin code to @product-full@ 7's API. As
a prerequisite, you set up your existing traditional plugin in a @product-full@ 7
Plugins SDK, in Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio. Then you find your
plugin's dependencies and configure them. Finally, you use the Code Upgrade Tool
to address upgrade issues. It's all straightforward.

+$$$

Note: Even if Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio (both use Eclipse) aren't your
favorite, you should use one of them to leverage the Code Upgrade Tool. When
you're done adapting your code, you can go back to your preferred IDE and tool
chain. 

$$$

Let's start by setting up your plugin in a @product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK using Liferay IDE
or Liferay Developer Studio.

## Setup [](id=setup)

The Code Upgrade Tool is available in Liferay IDE and Liferay Developer Studio
(versions 3.0 and newer). 

If you already have Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio, upgrade it to
version 3.0 or newer. Otherwise, download it from the product site:

* [Liferay IDE](https://web.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-projects/liferay-ide)

* [Liferay Developer Studio](https://web.liferay.com/group/customer/dxp/downloads/developer-tools)

Next, you need a @product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK for your traditional plugin. The new SDK
is available on the [downloads page](https://www.liferay.com/downloads).

Then, either move your plugin into the @product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK or unzip the 
@product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK on top of your existing Plugins SDK. This upgrades it 
to the latest version. 

In your `build.[username].properties` file, make sure to set the
`app.server.type` and `app.server.parent.dir` properties to refer to your
@product@ installation.

In Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio, set up your Liferay server and plugin
project as follows:

1.  Add a Liferay server and underlying runtime environment that targets your
    @product@ installation.

2.  Import your plugin project. Select *File &rarr; Import &rarr; Liferay &rarr;
    Liferay Plugins SDK Project* to bring up the wizard for importing and
    configuring your project.

Your existing plugin project, along with its Plugins SDK, appears in the IDE.
You're ready to adapt the plugin to @product-full@ 7!

## Resolving Module Dependencies [](id=resolving-module-dependencies)

Now that you've imported your plugin project to Liferay IDE or Developer Studio,
you probably see compile errors for some of the Liferay classes it uses.
They're listed as undefined classes or unresolved symbols because they've been
moved, renamed, or removed. As a part of modularization in @product-full@ 7, many of
these classes reside in new modules.

You need to resolve all of these Liferay classes for your plugin. Some of the
class changes are quick and easy to fix. Changes involving the new modules
require more effort to resolve, but are straightforward.

Liferay class changes and required adaptations are described below:

-   **Class moved to a package that's in the classpath**:  This change is 
    common and easy to fix. Since the module is already on your classpath, you
    need only update the class import. Two ways of doing this are by using the
    Code Upgrade Tool or by using an Eclipse feature. The Code Upgrade Tool
    reports each moved class for you to address one by one. Ecplise's feature
    automatically resolves multiple classes at once.

    It's typically faster to resolve moved classes using the mentioned Eclipse
    feature. Since Liferay IDE and Developer Studio are based on Eclipse, you
    can generate imports to classes in your classpath by using the *Organize
    Imports* keyboard sequence: *ctrl-shift-o*.

    If you have an import line
    that's in error, comment out the line or remove it. Then press
    *ctrl-shift-o*. If there's only one match for the class, an import statement
    is generated for it automatically. Otherwise a wizard appears, letting you
    select the fully qualified class name that matches the class. On selecting a
    matching fully qualified class, Eclipse inserts a corresponding import.

-   **Class moved to a module that's *not* in the classpath**: You must resolve
    the new module as a dependency for your project. This requires identifying
    the module and specifying your project's dependency on it. 

-   **Class replaced or removed**: The class has been replaced by another class
    or removed from the product. The Code Upgrade Tool (discussed later)
    explains what happened to the class, how to handle the class change, and
    why the change was made.

As explained above, resolving a class that's moved within your classpath is
straightforward. Consider resolving such classes first. 

The remainder of this tutorial explains how to resolve the last two cases and
starts with configuring your plugin project to declare the modules it needs. 

### Identifying Module Dependencies [](id=identifying-module-dependencies)

Before @product-full@ 7.0, all the platform APIs were in a single JAR file:
`portal-service.jar`. Many of these APIs are now in independent modules. 
Modularization has resulted in many benefits, as described in the article [Benefits of @product-full@ 7 for Liferay 6 Developers](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/benefits-of-liferay-7-for-liferay-6-developers#modular-development-paradigm)
One such advantage is that these API modules can evolve separately from the
platform kernel. They also simplify future upgrades. For example, instead of
having to check all of Liferay's APIs, each module's [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
indicates whether the module contains any backwards-incompatible changes. You
need only adapt your code to such modules (if any). 

As part of the modularization, `portal-service.jar` has been renamed
appropriately to `portal-kernel.jar`, as it continues to hold the portal
kernel's APIs. 

![Figure 1: The portal-service JAR file has been refactored. Application APIs have been extracted from it and it's been renamed *portal-kernel*.](../../../images/from-liferay-6-portal-apis-before-after.png)

Each app module consists of a set of classes that are highly cohesive and have
a specific purpose, such as providing the app's API, implementation, or web UI.
The app modules are much easier to understand and fun to work with. So next you'll
track down the modules that now hold the classes your plugin references.

Look at [Classes Moved from portal-service.jar](/web/guest/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/classes-moved-from-portal-service-jar),
which is a table that maps each class moved from `portal-service.jar` to its
new module. The table includes each class's new package and the module's version
at the time of @product@'s latest release. 

Note the following class information:

* *Module Symbolic Name*: The module's unique identifier
* *Module Version*: The module's version identifier
* *Package*: The class' Java package

You'll use this information to manage your plugin's dependencies on these modules.

**IMPORTANT**: The module versions in the @product@ source code are currently
one micro-version higher than what's actually in that @product@ release. For
example, even though the source code for the Liferay Journal API module
specifies version 2.0.2, version 2.0.1 is what's bundled with the @product@
release and is therefore the version you should specify. The module versions are
incremented for the module's next release version to make sure a new version is
associated with all module changes. **Make sure to specify one module
micro-version lower** than what's listed in the @product@ source code and in the
reference table, that's based on the source code. 

Your plugin might reference classes that are in Liferay utility modules, such as
`util-java`, `util-bridges`, `util-taglib`, or `util-slf4j`. Their module
artifacts are listed on the [MVNRepository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal)
site. All versions of each module are available. When you click on a
module version, the site shows options for the Ivy, Maven, or
Gradle dependency elements to specify in your project. Note the Ivy dependency
information, as the next section demonstrates using Ivy.

![Figure 2: The MVNRepository site conveniently presents module dependency elements for Ivy, Maven, Gradle, and more.](../../../images/from-liferay-6-mvnrepository-entry.png)

The following table shows each Liferay utility module's symbolic name, which
links to its artifacts.

**Liferay Utility Module Symbolics Names**

  **Liferay Utility** |  &nbsp;**Module Symbolic Name** |
:---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
 util-bridges           |  [`com.liferay.util.bridges`](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.util.bridges) |
 util-java               | [`com.liferay.util.java`](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.util.java) |
 util-slf4j               | [`com.liferay.util.slf4j`](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.util.slf4j) |
 util-taglib             | [`com.liferay.util.taglib`](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.util.taglib) |
 
As you inspect the module artifacts, note the *module symbolic name* and
*version* of the modules you use. Module dependency configuration is explained
shortly.

+$$$

Note: Previous versions of the Plugins SDK made `portal-service.jar` available
to projects; the @product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK similarly makes `portal-kernel.jar`
available. If you're using a Liferay bundle (i.e., @product@ pre-installed on an
app server), the Liferay utility modules are already in your classpath.

If you manually installed @product@ on your app server, the Liferay utility
modules might not be on your classpath. If a utility module you need is not on
your classpath, note its dependency elements.

$$$

Now that you have the module symbolic names and versions, you can make the
modules available to your plugin project.

The modules your plugin uses must be available to it at compile time and run
time. Here are two options for resolving module dependencies in your traditional
plugin project:

**Option 1: Use Ivy**

**Option 2: Work with dependency JAR files manually**

The next sections explain and demonstrate these options. Let's first consider
using Ivy.

### Managing Dependencies with Ivy [](id=managing-dependencies-with-ivy)

Apache Ivy provides an elegant approach to managing dependencies. You declare
your dependencies in an `ivy.xml` file in your plugin project's root folder. The
Plugins SDK's Ant tasks leverage the `ivy.xml` file, along with the Plugins
SDK's Ivy scripts, to download the specified modules and *their* dependencies,
and make them available to your plugin.

+$$$

**Note**: you can use Gradle or Maven in place of Ivy for dependency management;
but their use is out of the scope of this tutorial.

$$$

Here's an example dependency element for the Liferay Journal API version 2.0.1
module:

    <dependency name="com.liferay.journal.api" org="com.liferay" rev="2.0.1" />

Each dependency includes the module's name (`name`), organization (`org`), and
revision number (`rev`).

All Liferay modules use organization (`org`) value `"com.liferay"`.

At compile time, Ivy downloads the dependency JAR files to a cache folder so you
can compile against them. At deployment, the OSGi framework in @product@
installs and registers the dependency modules for runtime access. 

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to specify module version numbers *one micro-version
lower* than what's specified in the @product@ source code. The source code lists
one micro-version higher than what's associated with the @product@ release. 

If your project doesn't already have an `ivy.xml` file, you can get one by
creating a new plugin project in Liferay IDE or Developer Studio and copying the
`ivy.xml` file it generates.

For example, here are the Liferay 6.2 Knowledge Base portlet application's
`ivy.xml` file contents:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>

    <ivy-module
        version="2.0"
        xmlns:m2="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/maven"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/schemas/ivy.xsd"
    >
        <info module="knowledge-base-portlet" organisation="com.liferay">
            <extends extendType="configurations,description,info" location="${sdk.dir}/ivy.xml" module="com.liferay.sdk" organisation="com.liferay" revision="latest.integration" />
        </info>
    
        <dependencies defaultconf="default">
            <dependency org="com.liferay" name="com.liferay.markdown.converter" rev="1.0.2" />
        </dependencies>
    </ivy-module>

The Plugins SDK works with project Ivy files to store artifacts and make them
accessible to your plugin projects.

If you don't want to use Ivy, you can store dependency JARs within your plugin
project manually. Next, you'll learn about manual dependency management.

### Managing Dependencies Manually [](id=managing-dependencies-manually)

Managing dependencies manually is also viable. If you're already managing
dependencies using Ivy or some other dependency management framework, then you
can skip this section and continue at the section *Adapting to the API with the
Code Upgrade Tool*.

Manual dependency management involves downloading dependency JAR files and
adding them to your project's `WEB-INF/lib` folder.

Liferay JARs are available on the MVNRepository site: [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal)

The repository organizes modules and their artifacts in folders named after
module *symbolic names* and *versions*. For example, the Journal API module's
artifacts are accessible at [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay/com.liferay.journal.api/2.0.1](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay/com.liferay.journal.api/2.0.1)

Clicking a module's *Repository* link (e.g., link named `central`) takes you to
the module's Maven Central repository page. To download a module's JAR file,
click on the JAR file link from the Maven Central repository page. The Journal
API module's JAR file, for example, is `com.liferay.journal.api-2.0.1.jar`. 

As you manage module JARs, make sure to not *deploy* any OSGi framework JARs or
Liferay module JARs (e.g., *com.liferay.journal.api.jar*). If you deploy them
along with your plugin, they'll conflict with the JARs already installed in the
OSGi framework. Identical JARs existing in two different classloaders can cause
class cast exceptions.

The easiest way to exclude such JARs from your plugin's deployment is to list
them in a `deploy-excludes` property in your plugin's
`liferay-plugin-package.properties`. You must otherwise remove the JARs manually
from the plugin WAR file.

To exclude JARs in your plugin's `liferay-plugin-package.properties` file, add
an entry like this, replacing the square-bracketed items with the names of JAR
files to exclude:

    deploy-excludes=\
        **/WEB-INF/lib/[module-artifact.jar],\
        **/WEB-INF/lib/[another-module-artifact.jar]

Here's an example property that excludes OSGi framework JAR `osgi.core.jar` and
Liferay app module JAR `com.liferay.journal.api.jar`: 

    deploy-excludes=\
        **/WEB-INF/lib/com.liferay.portal.journal.api.jar,\
        **/WEB-INF/lib/org.osgi.core.jar

How do you know what modules are already installed in @product@? If your
@product@ instance has a particular Liferay App Suite installed, then don't
deploy module JARs you know are in that App Suite. For example, if the Web
Experience Management App Suite is already installed (which is the case for a
@product@ bundle), then don't deploy Web Content module JARs such as
`com.liferay.journal.api.jar`.

Searching for a module in @product@'s [App Manager](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/managing-and-configuring-apps).
is a sure-fire way to verify existing module installations.

Now that you've configured your plugin project's dependencies, you can use
Liferay's Code Upgrade Tool to adapt the rest of your plugin's code.

## Adapting to the API with the Code Upgrade Tool [](id=adapting-to-the-api-with-the-code-upgrade-tool)

The Code Upgrade Tool identifies areas in your code that need to be adapted to
Liferay's APIs changes. As @product-full@ 7 was being developed, some of the changes
were unavoidable and resulted in problems that affect plugin upgrades. They're
commonly known as *breaking changes* and are captured in @product@'s [Breaking Changes](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/breaking-changes)
document.

Liferay's Code Upgrade Tool finds and describes the upgrade issues. You can
either resolve each issue yourself or, if the tool enables an auto-correct
option for the issue, you can apply the tool's automatic fix. As you resolve the
upgrade problems, mark them complete in the Code Upgrade Tool's list.

To start the Code Upgrade Tool, follow these steps:

1. In the *Project Explorer*, right-select your plugin project.

2. Select *Liferay &rarr; Find @product-full@ 7 breaking API changes*

The following view appears.

![Figure 3: This view shows you where breaking changes affect your plugin. In addition, it provides background information on each change and explains how to adapt to it.](../../../images/from-liferay-6-upgrade-problems.png)

Upgrade problems are reported by file and line number. On selecting a problem
from the list, the following information about the problem appears: 

-  **Date**: When the change was introduced to the product.

-  **JIRA Ticket**: Corresponding issue number.

-  **What Changed?**: Summary of the code change.

-  **How should I update my code?**: Instructions on how to adapt your code in
    response to the change. 
    
-  **Why was the change made?**: Reasons for the change.

Here's the Code Upgrade Tool workflow:

1.  Double-click a problem in the list to go to the problem in the affected
    file.

2.  Correct the problem manually or automatically, if the Code Upgrade Tool
    offers an automatic fix. 

    To verify whether there is an automatic correction, right-click on the
    problem in the problem list. If there's a *Correct Automatically* option,
    you can select it to apply that correction. 

    ![Figure 4: The Code Upgrade Tool provides auto-correction for some issues.](../../../images/from-liferay-6-correct-automatically.png)

When an auto correction is applied to the code, an information icon (i) appears
next to the line of code. The icon identifies the affected line of code and
displays the issue's title when you hover over the icon. 

    ![Figure 5: On applying auto-correction, an information icon appears next to the affected line of code](../../../images/from-liferay-6-upgrade-tool-at-line.png)

3.  Mark the problem resolved.

4.  If more unresolved problems exist, go back to step 1.

For more details on an issue, inspect its JIRA ticket by visiting
<https://issues.liferay.com>, entering the ticket number in the search box, and
clicking the search icon. The issue's description and comments provide relevant
information.

Resolving all of a plugin's reported upgrade problems makes for a great start
in adapting your plugin to @product-full@ 7.

## Summary [](id=summary)

Congratulations on completing the first step in upgrading your plugin to @product@
7! Let's consider all that you've done.

You set up your plugin in a @product-full@ 7 Plugins SDK, imported it into Liferay IDE
or Liferay Developer Studio, and set up a @product-full@ 7 server in that IDE. Then,
you fixed class imports and resolved dependencies on all the modules your plugin
uses. Finally, you leveraged Liferay's Code Upgrade Tool to hunt down and adapt
to breaking API changes. Way to go!

It's onward and upward with upgrading your traditional plugins on @product-full@ 7!
