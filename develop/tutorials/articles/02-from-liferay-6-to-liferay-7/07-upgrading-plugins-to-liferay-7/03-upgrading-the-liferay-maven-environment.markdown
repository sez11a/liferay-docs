# Upgrading the Liferay Maven Environment

If you're an avid Maven user, and have been using it for Liferay Portal 6.2
project development, you must upgrade your Maven environment to be compatible
with @product-ver@ development. There are two main parts of the Maven
environment upgrade process that you'll cover in this tutorial:

- Upgrading Liferay Maven Plugins
- Upgrading Liferay Maven Artifacts

The changes for both of these parts will only occur in your parent POM and any
relevant child project POMs. You'll start off by upgrading your Maven
environment's Liferay Maven plugins.
