# OSGi Basics for Liferay Development [](id=osgi-basics-for-liferay-development)

Liferay leverages the OSGi framework to provide a development environment for
modular applications. There are many OSGi best practices that @product@ follows
to provide a platform for which it's easy to develop. In this section of
tutorials, you're introduced to some OSGi basics and common Liferay best
practices for your bundle's (module) development.

<!-- By Ray's request, I introduced the term *module* by first referencing
*bundle*. Ray suggested that since this section will focus on OSGi basics, that
we should refer to bundle first, since that's the term used in OSGi docs. Then
we can introduce our standard "module" Liferay term. This is just for clearness.
