# Rendering an Asset [](id=rendering-an-asset)

There are several options for rendering an asset. Before you set up the 
rendering process for your asset, make sure it's added to the asset framework 
by following the
[Adding, Updating, and Deleting Assets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/adding-updating-and-deleting-assets-for-custom-entities)
tutorial. Once you add your asset to the framework, you can render the 
asset using the Asset Publisher application. The default rendering 
process, however, only displays the asset's title and description text. 
Anything requires additional coding. For instance, you might want these 
additional things:

- An edit feature for modifying an asset.
- Viewing an asset in its original context (e.g., a blog
    in the Blogs application; a post in the Message Boards application).
- Embedding images, videos, and audio.
- Restricting access to users who do not have permissions to interact with the
    asset.
- Allowing users to comment on the asset. 

Liferay lets you dictate your asset's rendering capabilities by providing the
*Asset Renderer* framework. Implementing an asset renderer for an existing asset
is easy because Liferay offers interfaces and factories to help get your custom
asset rendering implemented fast. There are two things you must do to get your
asset renderer functioning properly for your asset:

- Create an asset renderer for your custom asset.
- Create an asset renderer factory to create an instance of the asset renderer
    for each asset entity.

You'll learn how to create an asset renderer and an asset renderer factory by
studying a Liferay asset that already uses both by default: Blogs. The Blogs
application offers many different ways to access and render a blogs asset.
You'll learn how a blogs asset provides an edit feature, comment section,
original context viewing (i.e., viewing an asset from the Blogs application),
workflow, etc. You'll also learn how it uses JSP templates to display various
blog views. The Blogs application is an extensive example of how an asset
renderer can be customized to fit your needs. 

If you want to create an asset and make it do more than display its title and
description, read on to learn more!

## Prerequisites for Asset Enabling and Application [](id=prerequisites-for-asset-enabling-and-application)

To asset-enable your application, you need two things: 

1.  The application must store asset data. Applications that store a data model
    meet this requirement.

2. The application must contain at least one non-instanceable portlet. `Edit` 
    links for the asset cannot be generated without a non-instanceable portlet.

Some applications may consist of only one non-instanceable portlet, while others
may consist of a both instanceable and non-instanceable portlets. If your 
application does not currently include a non-instanceable portlet, adding a 
configuration interface through a panel app will both enhance the usability of 
the application, and meet the requirement for adding a non-instanceable 
component to the application. See our tutorial on 
[Adding Custom Panel Apps](/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-the-product-menu#adding-custom-panel-apps)
to learn how to add one.

Now that you have all that taken care of, you can move on to creating an Asset 
Renderer.
