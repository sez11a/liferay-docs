#### Developing More Liferay Plugins with Maven [](id=developing-more-liferay-plugins-with-maven-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Did you think we covered all the available archetypes for developing Liferay
plugins? The Liferay team has been busy expanding our archetype list, and we're
proud to show you some additional plugins that you can create using Maven
archetypes. 

Check out these exciting archetypes that are available: 

- Liferay ServiceBuilder portlets 
- Liferay webs 
- Liferay Ext 
- JSF Portlet Archetype 
- ICEFaces Portlet Archetype 
- PrimeFaces Portlet Archetype 
- Liferay Faces Alloy Portlet Archetype 
- Liferay Rich Faces Portlet Archetype 

In addition, there are some Maven *goals* Liferay has provided: 

- DBBuilder - The `build-db` goal lets you execute the DBBuilder to generate SQL
  files. 
- SassToCSSBuilder - The `build-css` goal precompiles SASS in your css; this
  goal has been added to theme archetype. 

You now have plenty of archetypes at your disposal! 

"But the chair whose violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
Lenore II shall press, ah, nevermore!"

Lenore II didn't make it through the Maven section, but you did. You can
develop all your Liferay plugins using Maven; there's a standard process for
generating the archetypes and selecting your plugin options for each plugin
type. You can then customize the archetype to your liking. Using Maven to
develop plugins offers an easy and effective way to customize your Liferay
Portal. 

Are you wondering if we're going to make more terrible jokes that steal from
classic poetry? Quoth the Maven, "Probably." Let's summarize what we learned in
this chapter.

## Summary [](id=summary-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-02-en)

In this chapter, we covered many of Liferay's most popular development
strategies. You covered Liferay IDE, which serves as a workspace used for
customizing your Liferay instance. You also learned that when Liferay IDE is
paired with the Plugins SDK, you have a one stop development environment where
you can develop Liferay plugins, build them, and deploy them to your Liferay
instance.

You also learned all about developing Liferay plugins with the Maven build
framework. You configured Maven locally, downloaded and installed the required
Liferay Maven artifacts, and learned to create Liferay plugins with Maven.
You're ready to create all kinds of Liferay plugins based on Liferay's plugin
archetypes. Just don't let Lenore III sleep near the fire this time. 

Feeling confused by the number of features provided by Eclipse and Liferay IDE?
You can easily come across difficult questions and run into very specific
problems, but someone else might have already solved your issue or answered your
question. So where would you go to find out? Don't reinvent the wheel, visit the
[Liferay IDE Community page](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-ide/overview)!
On the *Forums* page, you can look up solutions to specific issues and ask
questions. Be sure to fully describe any problems you have to ensure you get a
working answer. You can even track known issues from the *Issue Tracker* page. 

Now that you have a firm grasp on Liferay's development tools, let's learn about
developing one of Liferay's most important components: portlets.
