# Customizing Liferay Portal [](id=customizing-liferay-portal-lp-6-2-develop-tutorial)

Liferay Hooks are the best type of plugin for customizing Liferay's core
features. If possible, use hooks whenever you need to override Liferay's core
functionality. It's possible to use Ext plugins for many of the same tasks, but
hooks are hot-deployable and more forward compatible, so we urge you to use them
preferentially. 

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to create hooks, and you'll
explore their most common uses.
