This folder contains an ordered list of article category folders. Each new
article must be saved to an article category folder and must be prefixed with
the next available number prefix.

For example, if you want to add a new article to the 01-users-and-organizations/
category folder and the folder has existing article files prefixed from '01-' to
'03-', prefix your new article file with '04-':

    01-users-and-organizations/
       01-adding-users.markdown
       02-updating-users.markdown
       03-adding-organizations.markdown
       04-[your-new-article].markdown
