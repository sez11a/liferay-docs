# Collaboration

@product@'s collaboration suite contains many apps and features that let users 
interact and create content together. This can be as simple as a quick 
conversation in the Message Boards app, or as complex as joint file management 
via the Documents and Media Library. The collaboration suite also contains Blogs 
and Wiki apps that let users create blog posts and wiki articles. What's more, 
users can can comment on and rate any kind of content. The end result is that 
the whole is greater than the sum of the parts--together, users create something 
of value that couldn't exist if they were each working in isolation. 

Underlying the collaboration suite is a set of powerful APIs that you can tap 
into to leverage these features in your own apps. For example, if your app lets 
users create a custom content type, you can leverage the collaboration suite's 
social features to also let users comment on and rate that content.
