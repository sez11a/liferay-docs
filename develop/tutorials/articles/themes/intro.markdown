# Themes and Layout Templates

Do you want to transform the look and feel of your Liferay Portal? Create your
own Liferay Theme! Themes are hot deployable plugins unique to a site. With
themes, you can alter the user interface so completely that it's difficult or
impossible to tell that the site is running on Liferay. In this section of
tutorials, you'll learn how to develop themes.

In addition to transforming your site's look and feel, Layout Templates allow
you to choose how portlets will be arranged on a page. They simple tables or
CSS-based containers into which portlets can be dropped and sit within the body
of the page. Liferay Portal comes with several built-in layout templates, but if
you require a more complex page layout you may wish to create your own custom
layout templates. You'll learn how to develop layout
templates in these tutorials too.
