# Creating Themes with the Liferay Theme Generator [](id=creating-themes-with-the-liferay-theme-generator)

The Liferay Theme Generator is an easy-to-use command-line wizard that
streamlines the theme creation process. It is independent of the Liferay Plugins
SDK, and works for Liferay versions 6.2 and up. This tutorial focuses on
creating themes for Liferay 7.0. In just a few steps, you'll have a working
Liferay theme. The first step is to install the theme generator.

**Note:** The Liferay Theme Generator is still in development and is not
guaranteed to work on all platforms and environments.

## Installing the Theme Generator [](id=installing-the-theme-generator)

The theme generator has several dependencies. You'll learn how to install these
dependencies and then install the theme generator.

+$$$

**Windows Prerequisites**

By default, the generator uses node-sass which requires node-gyp. Furthermore,
node-gyp requires Python and Visual Studio. The [node-gyp Installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
instructions explain how you can set this up.

Alternatively you can use the Ruby based version of Sass. In order to use that 
version of Sass, you must install Ruby with the [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/), 
and then install the Sass and Compass gems using the following command: 

    gem install sass compass
    
These are the initial steps you will need to run for Windows. Once the theme is
generated you will have to make a few more changes to the configuration files,
which is covered below.

$$$

Follow these steps to install the generator's dependencies:

1.  Install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/), if you don't have it installed
    already. 

    To test your Node.JS installation, execute the following command:

        node -v

    The resulting output should look similar to this:

        v4.2.2

    Note: To avoid any potential compatibility issues, we recommend installing
    the Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js . At the time of this
    writing, the LTS version is v4.2.2.

    Node Package Manager (NPM) is installed along with Node.js. 

2.  Setup your npm environment. 

    First, create an `.npmrc` file in your user's home directory. This helps
    you bypass npm permission-related issues. 

    In the `.npmrc` file, specify a `prefix` property like this one:

        prefix=/Users/[username]/.npm-packages

    Set the `prefix` value based on your user's home directory. Globally
    installed npm packages will be installed to the `prefix` location. 

    Next, set node system environment variables like these:

        NPM_PACKAGES=/Users/[username]/.npm-packages (same as prefix value)
        NODE_PATH=${NODE_PATH}:${NPM_PACKAGES}/lib/node_modules

    As a last step, since npm installs Yeoman and gulp executables to
    `${NPM_PACKAGES}/bin` on UNIX and to `%NPM_PACKAGES%` on Windows, make sure
    to add the appropriate directory to your system path. For example, on UNIX
    you'd set this:

        PATH=${PATH}:${NPM_PACKAGES}/bin

3.  Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
    global using the following command:

        npm install -g yo gulp

Now you're ready to install the theme generator. Install it by executing this
command:

    npm install -g generator-liferay-theme

Now that the theme generator and its dependencies are installed, you can
generate a theme. 

## Running the Theme Generator [](id=running-the-theme-generator)

<!--
When you installed the Liferay Theme Generator, you also installed two
sub-generators with it: a themelet creator, and a theme importer. For the
purposes of this tutorial, the focus will be on the default theme generator. 
To learn how to use the generator to create themelets and import themes, you 
can read the Extending your Theme Using Themelets tutorial and the Importing and 
Upgrading Themes tutorials.

Need to add back once the tutorials are live-->

From a directory in which you want to create a 7.0 theme, run the following
command:

    yo liferay-theme

+$$$

Note: If you run into permissions issues during theme generation, make sure you
have read/write access to all folders on your system. 

$$$

The theme generator prompts you for the following things:

1. Enter a name for your theme.

2. Enter a theme ID, or press *enter* to accept the default. 

3. Select the version of your Liferay instance (e.g., *7.0*).

4. Choose a template language.

    Based on the inputs up to this point, the default generator starts
    installing additional required software and creating your theme project. 

5. When prompted, enter your app server's path. The information you
   provide is added to the `liferay-theme.json` in your theme's root directory.
   you can change the path in that file if you change app servers.
   
6. Finally, enter your app server's URL, or press *enter* to accept the default
   `localhost:8080`.

The generator creates a new theme project in your current directory. The theme
inherits styles from the [liferay-theme-styled](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liferay-theme-styled)
theme. Note that you can change the base theme using the `gulp extend` command.

+$$$

**Note**: By default, your theme is based off of the styled theme and uses 
lib-sass/bourbon, instead of Compass. If, however, you are on Windows and 
are using the Ruby version of Sass, you must configure the theme to support
Compass. 

1.  Open the `package.json` file found in the root folder of your theme, and
    locate the `supportCompass` property and change it from `false` to `true`.
   
    Now that your theme is set to support Compass, you will need to install the
    Ruby Sass middleware and save it as a dependency for your theme.
    
2.  Run the following command to install the Ruby Sass middleware:

        npm i --save gulp-ruby-sass
        
    The `--save` flag adds Ruby Sass to the list of dependencies in your theme's
    `package.json` file. Your theme is ready to use.
 
$$$

There you have it! You now have a working theme. At the moment, the theme is a
bit bare bones, but you have everything you need to get started. The generated
theme's structure differs slightly from a theme created in the Liferay Plugins
SDK.

In a theme generated in the Liferay Plugins SDK, you put changes in a `_diffs`
directory. In a theme generated by the Liferay Theme Generator, you put changes
in the `src` directory.

Another noticeable difference in the generator created theme is that all CSS
files have been converted to Sass SCSS files. Sassy CSS (SCSS) is the new main
syntax which allows you to use the latest CSS3 styles and leverage Sass syntax
advantages, such as nesting and variables.

Now that your theme is created, and you understand your theme's anatomy, you can
take use the theme project's gulp tasks to extend and deploy your theme.

## Theme Gulp Tasks [](id=theme-gulp-tasks)

Your theme's `gulpfile.js` file has several tasks you can execute in your
theme project's root folder. 

Here are the gulp tasks you can execute:

*  `build`: generates the base theme files, compiles Sass into CSS, and
    zips all theme files into a `.war` file that you can deploy to a Liferay
    server. 

*  `deploy`: runs the `build` task and deploys the `.war` file to the
    configured local app server. 

    If you want to deploy to a live remote server, specify the `--live` flag
    along with the `deploy` task (e.g., `gulp deploy --live`).

    Note that the
    [server-manager-web](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/master/webs/server-manager-web)
    plugin must deployed on the server you specify. The `--live` flag will
    deploy to the remote server specified in the `init` task--the `init` task is
    explained later in this section.

    If you want to deploy to a different server without changing the default
    server specified in `init`, you may use the `--url` flag.

        gulp deploy --live --url http://some-host.com

    You may also specify your login credentials using flags `-u` or `--username`
    and flags `-p` or `--password`.

        gulp deploy --live -u test@liferay.com -p test

*  `extend`: allows you to specify a base theme to extend. By default, themes
    created with the [theme 
    generator](https://github.com/liferay/generator-liferay-theme) are based off
    of the [styled theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liferay-theme-styled).

    You first are prompted if you want to extend a Base theme or Themelet, then
    you're be prompted for where you would like to search for modules. Selecting
    *Globally installed npm modules* will search globally accessible npm modules
    on your computer. Selecting *npm registry* will search for published modules
    on npm.

    After you've selected modules from the options it provides the modules are
    added to your `package.json` file as dependencies. Run `npm install` to
    install them.

*  `init`: prompts you for local and remote app server information to use in
    theme deployment.

*  `status`: displays the name of the base theme/themelets your theme extends. 

*  `watch`: allows you to see the changes you make to your theme without
    requiring a full redeploy. After invoking the `watch` task, every time you
    save any changes to a file in your theme, applicable changes are compiled
    and they're copied directly to your app server. **Note:** In order for the
    `watch` task to work, you must have [Developer
    Mode](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-developer-mode-with-themes)
    enabled. <!--Update link to 7.0 URL once it's updated-->

There you have it! You're ready to design terrific themes!
