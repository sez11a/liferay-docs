# Application Decorators [](id=application-decorators)

In previous versions of Liferay, administrators could display or hide the
application borders through the *Show Borders* option of the look and feel
configuration menu. In Liferay 7.0 this option has been replaced with 
Application Decorators, a more powerful mechanism to customize the style of the 
application wrapper.

If you inspect the markup of your Liferay application when it's on a page you'll 
observe that it is wrapped by two layers. Among other things, these layers 
provide some common basic features like the drag and drop and the application 
border style. In order to protect these features, you cannot modify the markup 
of these layers directly with a theme.

Application Decorators provide a mechanism to add a custom CSS class to one of 
these wrapping layers via a userâ€™s setting. By defining styles for this class in 
your theme, you can change the look and feel of the application instances where 
the Application Decorator is applied, including its wrapper.

The figure below shows the markup of the layers wrapping a Liferay application
when the *Decorate* Application Decorator is applied:

Once your Application Decorator is complete, apply it to your applications
through the [Look and Feel Configuration menu](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/look-and-feel-configuration).

Your application's decor is now in your hands.
