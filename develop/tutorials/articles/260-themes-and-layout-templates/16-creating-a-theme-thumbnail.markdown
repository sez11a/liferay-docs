# Creating a Theme Thumbnail [](id=creating-a-theme-thumbnail)

Once you've created a theme, you'll probably want to create a theme thumbnail 
next. This lets users quickly identify your theme. It's especially important 
to provide thumbnails when your theme offers [color schemes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/specifying-color-schemes). 

Here are the steps for setting up a thumbnail image for your theme:

1.  Create a thumbnail image. Make sure it's 150 pixels wide by 120 pixels high.
    You may want to take a snapshot of your theme and re-size it to these
    dimensions. **Your thumbnail must be these exact dimensions** or your image 
    won't display properly. 

2.  Save the image as a `.png` file named `thumbnail.png` and place it in your
    theme's `images` folder (create this folder if it doesn't already exist). On 
    redeployment, your `thumbnail.png` file automatically displays as your 
    theme's thumbnail.

Now, when you apply your theme, your theme's thumbnail displays along with the 
other themes that are available to your site.
